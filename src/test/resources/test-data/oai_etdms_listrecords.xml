                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis describes a binding-induced DNA nanosensor and its application to homogeneous detection of DNA and proteins. This nanosensor was based on the binding-induced assembly of fluorescently labeled DNA on the DNA-functionalized quantum dots, resulting in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the quantum dots (605 QDs) and the fluorescent dye (Cy5). The sensor was applied to the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the p53 gene sequence and the detection of platelet derived growth factor, with pM detection limits. This strategy can be applied to developing assays for a wide range of targets by functionalizing the surface of quantum dots with appropriate affinity ligands (e.g., aptamers and antibodies).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study examines settler culture representations of the mixed-pine forests and the anomalous mountain pine beetle in the northern interior forests of British Columbia, Canada. Primary materials are discussed as potential or existing examples of art and literature as which contributes to BC northern interior bioregional culture. The primary sources include settler memoirs, a back to the land narrative, interviews with nine settler culture residents, and contemporary poetry, installation art, and drawing set in the BC northern interior. This project examines the anomalous mountain pine beetle population of 2004 – 2011 in the context of a culture focused on resource extraction, and postulates that the anomalous mountain pine beetle brings unique, if unsettling, challenges to the development of a sustainable bioregional culture in the BC northern interior.
Bioregionalism is the practice of attaching to and learning and living in a home bioregion with the intention of developing ecologically and socially sustainable culture and reinhabiting formerly ecologically harmed or otherwise altered ecosystems. This study brings the ideas of bioregionalism to a colonized state and recognizes the complexity of bioregionalism in a politically and ecologically complex region. To this end, this project addresses settler culture disregard for indigenous land rights and knowledge. Since a bioregion is a cultural as well as a biological ecology, this study acknowledges the ongoing repression and genocide of indigenous people and First Nations culture in British Columbia. Further, contemporary
and historical settler culture art and literature do not adequately address indigenous land claims and colonial violence, but do show potential for creative alternatives to reductive ecological relationships.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Counting unique number of people in a video (i.e., counting a person only once while the person passes through the field of view (FOV)), is required in many video analytic applications, such as transit passenger and pedestrian volume count in railway stations, malls and road intersections,  aid in security and resource management, urban planning, advertising and many others. 

In this PhD thesis I have developed a robust algorithm to generate unique people count from monocular videos taken from an arbitrary angle. From applications point of view, my algorithm is one of the most economical ones, because it can work with existing video cameras already mounted.  Within a region of interest (ROI) on the FOV of the camera, I compute influx/outflux rate of people, i.e., number of people coming in or going out of the ROI per unit time. Then, I sum the influx/outflux rate between any two time points to estimate the number of people that entered and/or left the ROI within that time interval. I employ two well-known computer vision techniques for this purpose: Gaussian process regression (GPR) to estimate the number of people present within a ROI and optical flow-based tracking of the boundary of the ROI.

The principle roadblock in most of computer vision problems is occlusion. To avoid this bottleneck, we adopt the combination of (a) the concept of influx and outflux of fluid mass from computational fluidics, (b) the GPR to estimate the number of people within a ROI and (c) ROI boundary tracking (as opposed to object or feature tracking) for a short period. Thus, the principal contribution of the thesis is to successfully handle occlusions by computing the average influx and/or outflux of people and avoiding people detection and tracking.

We validate the proposed algorithm on 19 publicly available monocular benchmark videos. Occlusions are abundant in these videos, yet we obtain more than 95% accuracy for most of these videos. We also extend our proposed framework beyond monocular videos and apply it on multiple views of a publicly available dataset with about 99% accuracy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study is a part of a field experiment constructed at the Diavik Diamond Mine in northern Canada to investigate water flow, geochemical reactions, thermal and gas transport within unsaturated piles of mine waste rock in a continuous permafrost permafrost. Diavik waste rock is categorized by its sulfur content: Type I rock, Type II rock and Type III rock . Three experiment waste-rock piles of 15 m high were constructed to achieve the project objectives. Two uncovered test piles are referred to as Type I test pile (Type I rock) and Type III test pile (Type III rock). The third test pile is covered test pile in which the Type III rock is covered by a layer of 1.5 m till and 3 m Type I rock. Three drill holes of 40 m depth in a 80 m high pile were also instrumented to reexamine the results of the test piles. This thesis focuses on the thermal aspects of the project. Thermal measurements in the uncovered piles implied the importance of wind on heat transport. Temperatures within the piles were found to decrease with time and permafrost aggradation near the base and in bedrock foundation. At the covered pile, temperatures at and below the till cover were frozen. There was no significant impact of wind on temperatures below the cover and heat influx across the cover was small. Bedrock foundation temperature of the covered pile showed a small cooling trend and less fluctuation compared to bedrock foundation of the uncovered piles. Linear stability analysis for the onset of natural air convection in waste-rock piles with physical properties based on Diavik waste rock was also performed. The results indicate that oxidation can create sufficient temperature gradients (or buoyancy forces) to trigger natural air convection. Ground temperatures of three 40 m drill hole in the 80 m high full-scale pile showed that conduction was dominated and the pile was cooling. According to numerical simulations, using air convection cover (ACC) the 80 m high pile will be frozen for the next 100 years under a proposed climate warming for the site. Furthermore, numerical simulations also showed that ACC can maintain frozen condition within waste-rock piles even though there was a heat release due to sulfide oxidation. This heat release may create natural air convection within waste-rock piles which aids in its removal.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this thesis was to identify water reuse program management strategies, obtain a sample of accepted water reuse permitting practices, and establish program development strategies from selected US jurisdictions with a history of industrial reuse in order to assist industry stakeholders in the development of a water reuse initiative in Alberta.
Seven US jurisdictions were selected and studied (California, Arizona, Florida, Texas, Washington, Colorado, and Oregon).  The results suggest that a single permitting agency with a public health agency assuming a role of consultant on an as-need basis was the favoured water reuse program management strategy.  Accepted reuse permitting practices were separated between water quality and water quantity.  Water quality permitting did not vary with each reuse application and water quantity permitting practices were dependent on a utilities ownership of effluent prior to discharge.  Important program development strategies include public education, identifying reusable waters, and establishing industry partnerships.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis we consider the task of catching a moving target with multiple pursuers, also known as the “Pursuit Game”, in which coordination among the pursuers is critical. Our testbed is inspired by the pursuit problem in video games, which require fast planning to guarantee fluid frame rates. We apply supervised machine learning methods to automatically derive efficient multi-agent pursuit strategies on rectangular grids. Learning is achieved by computing training data off-line and exploring the game tree on small problems. We also generalize the data to previously unseen and larger problems by learning robust pursuit policies, and run empirical comparisons between several sets of state features using a simple learning architecture. The empirical results show that 1) the application of learning across different maps can help improve game-play performance, especially on non-trivial maps against intelligent targets, and 2) simple heuristic works effectively on simple maps or less intelligent targets.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examines the development of feminine self in Li Ang’s fiction during different stages of her writing. Beginning in the 1980s, the rise of Taiwanese women writers has been one of the most significant phenomena in the history of Taiwanese literature, fundamentally challenging what has traditionally been a male domain. Women writers demanded to be regarded with the same respect as male writers. Also, they focused their concern on female inferiority in a patriarchal society. Li Ang is one of them. Not only does she illustrate the issues of women being repressed by patriarchy, but also she has worked out a feminist solution to those issues. In this thesis I will focus my discussion on three of Li Ang’s representative works, The Butcher’s Wife, The Labyrinth Garden, and Bewitching Love, to examine how Li Ang has re-established the female “Garden of Eden”, namely feminine self, in her fiction.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation examines four Indigenous novels published in Canada and the United States between 1990 and 2000.  Building upon Indigenous and non-Indigenous theories of literary nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and globalization, this project focuses on narrative articulations of Indigenous cultural and political sovereignty that foreground and are cognizant of global political, economic, cultural, and environmental entanglements. One of the key intentions of this study is to underscore the importance of examining how modes of Indigenous being-in-common are articulated in fiction written within a context of neoliberalism. Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead is foundational in terms of its critique of the practices and ideologies of neoliberal globalization, its representation of Indigenous modes of being-in-relation and resistance, its association of Indigenous sovereignty with transnational, inter-tribal, and alliance-based movements. Linda Hogan’s Solar Storms offers an Indigenous critique of neoliberalism from an environmental standpoint, foregrounding the importance of Indigenous ecologies, knowledges, and relations in the face of neoliberal globalization. Sherman Alexie’s Indian Killer articulates urban Indigenous community practices in resistance to urban neoliberal governmentality, ongoing colonial policies of erasure, and material and intellectual dispossession. Jeannette Armstrong’s Whispering in Shadows explores the context of Indigenous liberation struggles in the Americas, as well as global Indigenous activism at the international level. I argue that these novels represent a broad spectrum of Indigenous responses in 1990s North America to the economic, environmental, cultural, and political consequences of neoliberal globalization for Indigenous practices of community, nationalism, and sovereignty. Ultimately, they imagine and problematize possibilities for resistance, for conceptualizing justice, and for understanding our complex interrelationships with others.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Commonly in clinical settings, the patient’s posture is visually evaluated by the clinician using anatomical landmark references. However, this measurement is subjective and not quantifiable. Photogrammetry to assess posture was thought to be a possible good clinical alternative to the other methods because it is non-invasive, quantifiable, and less expensive. However, more tests were needed to determine its validity. This study tested the reliability and the validity of five angles measuring craniocervical posture using photogrammetry. Radiographs and photographs of the craniocervical posture of 39 healthy-female subjects were taken in a standardized sagittal standing position. Markers were placed on the back of the subject’s neck and ear. A second photograph and radiograph was taken 1 week later using 21 of the 39 subjects to test reliability. The angles were analyzed using Alcimage® software. Intraclass-correlation coefficient and standard error of measurement was used to test the reliability. Concurrent validity was tested using Pearson correlation and regression analysis. Discriminant analysis was used to test the discriminant validity. Sensitivity/specificity and predicted values were also calculated. The results showed that photogrammetry ICC values were good to excellent when assessed by 2 raters (ICC=0.89-0.99). The posture of the subjects was reproducible when tested using radiographs (ICC=0.89-0.98). One rater was reliable in reattaching the markers (ICC=0.71-0.91) and precise in locating the reference spinous processes (87.8%). Craniovertebral angle (CVA) appeared to be valid in measuring the position of the head in relation to the cervical spine (r=0.84) and to be able discriminate subjects with aligned posture, slight forward head posture (SFHP), and forward head posture (FHP) assessed by 1 rater (84.6% correctly classified). Cervical inclination angle (CIA) appears to be valid in discriminating subjects with aligned and FHP (86% and 88% respectively) but moderate to predict the cervical spine inclination. The cervical lordosis angles were not able to discriminate postures and predict the cervical lordosis. CVA and CIA were able to detect postural differences through the sensitivity/specificity and predicted values analysis. This study supports the validation of CVA and CIA to assess craniocervical posture which may improve the ability of the clinician to detect and quantify craniocervical postural alterations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Extending electronic devices beyond the limitations of current micro-electronics manufacturing will require detailed knowledge of how to make contacts to semiconductor surfaces. In this work, we investigated several methods by which such connections to silicon surfaces could be achieved. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was our main experimental tool, allowing direct imaging of the surfaces at the atomic level.

First, the growth of self-forming linear nanostructures of organic molecules on silicon surfaces offers a possibility of creating devices with hybrid organic-silicon functionality. We have studied the growth of many different molecules on a variety of hydrogen-terminated silicon surfaces: H-Si(100)-2x1, H-Si(100)-3x1, and H-Si(111)-1x1. We found molecular growth patterns affected by steric crowding, by sample doping level, or by exposure to ion-pump created radicals. We formed the first contiguous "L-shaped" molecular lines, and used an external electric field to direct molecular growth. We attempted to study a novel method for nanoscale information transfer along molecular lines based on excitation energy transfer.

The second part of the work focuses on the development and use of a new multiple-probe STM instrument. The design and the custom STM control software written for it are described. Connections to Si surfaces were achieved with a combination of lithographically defined metal contacts and STM tips. Two-dimensional surface conductivity of the Si(111)-7x7 surface was measured, and the effect of modifying the surface with organic molecules was investigated. A novel method, scanning tunneling fractional current imaging (STFCI), was developed to further study surface conductance. This method allowed us to determine, for the first time, that the resistance of steps on the Si(111)-7x7 surface is significantly higher than that of the surface alone.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Almost all mammalian cells contain energy-producing organelles called mitochondria. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a phospholipid which has been implicated to be important for mitochondrial function. The majority of mitochondrial PE is synthesized in mitochondria using the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) pathway. To test the hypothesis that PE made from the PSD pathway is required for mitochondrial function, three Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell lines with different PSD-pathway defects were studied. These three cell lines referred to as PSB-2, R-41, and PSD knockdown cells all had ~35% reductions in mitochondrial PE levels compared to the parental cell line. As a result, the mitochondria from all three cell lines have abnormally high sedimentation densities and increased membrane potentials. However, the energy production, motility, and morphologies of each type of mutant mitochondria were each distinctly different from their parental cell line.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis presents an experimental study of a bovine vertebra using transmission and pulse-echo methods and a preliminary investigation to guide a screw insertion into a pedicle using TomoScan phased array unit. 
The results show the cancellous bone has higher attenuation than the cortical bone for 1.0-5.0 MHz.  The optimal frequencies for imaging are found to be 3.5 and 5.0 MHz. When the sample is filled with water with the cancellous core removed, all reflections from the layers and screw are visible; however when the core is present, only reflections from the top cortex are identifiable. 
For the preliminary study, size and placement of the transducer array are important.  When the ultrasound beam is normal to the pedicle surface, echoes from the pedicle layers and the steel bit are strong; otherwise, signals are weak and not even identifiable.  Larger aperture size will enhance the signal-to-noise ratio but deteriorate lateral resolution.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis consists of two studies on joint bandwidth and power allocation strategy for wireless communication
networks. In the first study, joint bandwidth and power allocation strategy is proposed for wireless multi-user networks without relaying and with decode-and-forward relaying. It is shown that the formulated resource allocation problems are convex and, thus, can be solved efficiently. Admission control problem based on the joint bandwidth and power allocation strategy is further considered, and a greedy search algorithm is developed for solving it efficiently. In the second study, joint bandwidth
and power allocation strategy is presented for maximizing the sum ergodic capacity of secondary users under fading channels in cognitive radio networks. Optimal bandwidth allocation is derived in closed-form for any given power allocation. Then the structures of optimal power allocations are derived. Using these structures, efficient algorithms are developed for finding the optimal power allocations.</etd_ms:description>

A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security mechanism that is widely used to maintain the security of web services by preventing malicious programs from accessing these resources automatically. Despite the existence of several types of CAPTCHAs, many of them have been compromised due to their inherent vulnerabilities and the development of strong artificial intelligence and image recognition algorithms. The vulnerabilities of existing CAPTCHAs coupled with the trend of heavier dependence on the Internet calls for the development of a new generation of CAPTCHAs that are substantially more complex for machines, and yet easy to understand and solve by human users. 
In this thesis, we propose, implement and test a new CAPTCHA, which shows resistance against various forms of segmentation and recognition attacks. The multi-layered security approach employed in this CAPTCHA mainly comes from its use of Unicode as an input space, a virtual keyboard as the input device, the use of homoglyphs, the correlated usage of color in the foreground and background, and solution submission through intelligent human interaction. Furthermore, several forms of randomization are employed within different elements of the CAPTCHA which minimize the formation of detectable patterns that can be exploited by machines and make the attacks computationally complex for attackers. Our analyses provide evidence for substantial resistance of the proposed CAPTCHA against major attack types.
Our CAPTCHA’s game-like solution procedure is enjoyable and intuitive for human users despite its relatively longer solution time compared to existing CAPTCHAs which comes as the price for the higher level of security it affords. Our user studies indicate that the CAPTCHA’s solving accuracy is comparable to major CAPTCHAs in use today.
The complexity of this CAPTCHA can be further modified based on the security requirements of the resource being protected. Additional security- and usability-enhancing modifications are proposed and tested, which can further improve the CAPTCHA’s security or usability as needed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Do women municipal politicians encounter the same level of media bias as their national counterparts? This question guided a study of how three daily and three community newspapers portrayed women and men council candidates during the 2007 Alberta municipal election. Using content and discourse analysis, the study compared how journalists covered female and male candidates’ personal traits, campaign platforms, public utterances, and electoral viability as well as how visible both groups of candidates were in newspaper election coverage. Results from the study indicate that while aspiring women councillors do face a subtle sexism, the media environment they encounter while campaigning is generally more gender-neutral and hospitable to them than the one awaiting women competing for elite national office. Thus, scholarly belief that the media act can as a barrier to women’s candidacy are largely unfounded at the municipal level.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Transcription and DNA replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) occur in nuclear domains adjacent to structures named ND10. The HSV-1 single-stranded DNA binding protein ICP8 localizes to these nuclear domains to direct the assembly of the pre- and replication compartments.  
Inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases with roscovitine inhibits HSV-1 DNA replication, even in the presence of all required HSV-1 proteins, at an unidentified step. Here I show that roscovitine inhibits the localization of pre-expressed ICP8 to new replication sites. Therefore, the inhibition of HSV-1 DNA replication occurs at a step prior to initiation.  I next evaluated the mechanisms of inhibition of proper ICP8 localization. ICP8 was extracted at lower salt concentrations from roscovitine-treated than untreated cells, but the affinity of ICP8 for ssDNA in vitro was not affected.   
I propose that roscovitine inhibits HSV-1 DNA replication by inhibiting DNA accessibility.  I also discuss alternative mechanisms.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Headwater streams in Alberta’s Rocky Mountains are important in regulating aquatic ecosystem function and a range of downstream water resources but are vulnerable to stresses imposed by disturbances including those exerted by logging. The objectives of this research were to determine if the legacy of past forest harvesting impacts could be detected in altered sediment-nutrient dynamics and primary productivity in headwaters in the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Alberta. A descriptive, process-based case study was conducted in an undisturbed-disturbed watershed pair where one watershed had undergone extensive harvesting ending in 1990. The disturbed watershed was found to have higher concentrations of suspended solids and fine streambed material, and considerably greater levels of aqueous and particulate phosphorus (P). Primary productivity was much higher in the disturbed system, likely caused by elevated P levels. This study illustrates the potential for logging disturbance to produce long-lived impacts on stream ecology in critical headwater regions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this thesis was to identify differences in torque expression between three brands of metallic self-ligating brackets with stainless steel, TMA® and CuNiTi® wire and to compare active and passive designs. 150 of each Damon-3MX (Ormco Inc, Orange, CA, USA), SPEED (Strite Industries, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) and In-Ovation-R (GAC, Bohemia, NY, USA) brackets were measured for torque expression (Nmm) in an Air-shields Isolette® infant incubator. Torque expression in SPEED and In-Ovation-R brackets began at approximately 7.5° vs. 12° with Damon-3MX.  Clinically applicable torque expression (5-20Nmm) was observed from approximately 15-30° in SPEED &amp; In-Ovation-R brackets with stainless steel wire. In Damon-3MX, comparable torsional moments were expressed from 18-30°. With TMA wire, SPEED exerted clinically applicable torsional moments from 18-39°, In-Ovation-R from 21-39° and Damon-3MX from 21-42°. For CuNiTi wire, SPEED expressed torsional moments of 5-20Nmm from 21-72°, In-Ovation-R from 24-63° and Damon-3MX from 27-78°.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This action research project seeks to explore the question, “how can the community dances of Alberta’s past become a context for learning in the Alberta grade four music program?” This question gives the researcher an opportunity to explore several things, one of which is David Elliott’s idea of music education as praxis, which is explored through teaching a unit of instruction “praxially,” and having it culminate in a cultural/ musical event, a historical community “schoolhouse dance” simulation. Because the research method for this project is action research, the researcher is able to interrogate his practice as a music teacher. Finally, at a time of planned change to Alberta’s fine arts curriculum, this study contributes to the discussion about what the nature of arts education in Alberta can - and should - be by exploring the areas of: community involvement; student engagement; and the integration of other subject areas within music learning.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: We address the problem of finding ‘surprising’ patterns of variable length in sequence data, where a surprising pattern is defined as a subsequence of a longer sequence, whose observed frequency is statistically significant with respect to a given distribution.Finding statistically significant patterns in sequence data is the core task in some interesting applications such as Biologicial motif discovery and anomaly detection. We investigate the problem of ‘redundant patterns’, where the presence of few ‘true’ anomalous patterns in the data could cause a large number of highly-correlated patterns to stand statistically significant just because of those few anomalous patterns. Identifying ‘true’ anomalies in a set with many ‘redundant patterns’ can be challenging. Our approach to solving this problem is based on capturing the dependencies between patterns through an ‘explain’ relationship where a set of patterns can explain the statistical significance of another pattern. The ‘explain’ relationship allows us to address the problem of redundancy by choosing a few ‘core’ patterns which explain the significance of all other significant patterns. We propose a greedy
algorithm for efficiently finding an approximate core pattern set of minimum size. To extend the utility of our method to a broader class of applications, the proposed
framework is generalized by allowing the ‘surprising patterns’ to represent a class
of subsequences with a certain amount of variation w.r.t a core pattern. Using both
synthetic and real-world sequential data, chosen from different domains including
Medicine, Computer Security, and Bioinformatics, we show that the proposed notion
of core patterns very closely matches the notion of ‘true’ surprising patterns in
data. We also compare our method with five other well-known anomaly detection
techniques. The results show a better matching of our predictions with the ground
truth compared to those of our comparison partners. When compared with 14 wellknown
methods on the interesting application of the Biological motif discovery, and
on a widely-used benchmark, our proposed method achieves better or comparable
results in finding motifs, a special case of our surprising patterns.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In response to the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) threat in Alberta, forest companies plan to surge harvest 75% of susceptible (mature) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands over 20 years.  To assess potential changes to grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) habitat, I projected food availability over 60 years in the Upper Foothills.  I also examined grizzly bear response to pine age, and its interaction with elevation and edge proximity.  Post surge, forbs were predicted to increase by 25% and fruits by 2%.  After 60 years, forbs should remain above (13%) while fruits could decline below (10%) pre-harvest conditions.  Less Vaccinium membranaceum shrubs above 1228m and reduced Vaccinium myrtilloides fruit production below 1228m contributed to the decline.  If the surge cut proceeds, efforts should be made to increase fruit production by enhancing shrubs at specific environmental conditions (age, elevation).  Small cut-blocks near non-harvested pine seemed to be particularly beneficial for bears.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Internal gravity waves grow in amplitude as they propagate upwards in a non-Boussinesq fluid and weakly nonlinear effects develop due to interactions with an induced horizontal mean flow. In this work, a new derivation for this wave-induced mean flow is presented and nonlinear Schrodinger equations are derived describing the weakly nonlinear evolution of these waves in an anelastic gas and non-Boussinesq liquid. The results of these equations are compared with fully nonlinear numerical simulations. It is found that interactions with the wave-induced mean flow are the dominant mechanism for wave evolution. This causes modulational stability for hydrostatic waves, resulting in propagation above the overturning level predicted by linear theory for a non-Boussinesq liquid. Due to high-order dispersion terms in the Schrodinger equation for an anelastic gas, hydrostatic waves become unstable and break at lower levels. Non-hydrostatic waves are modulationally unstable, overturning at lower levels than predicted by linear theory.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Reverse auctions for ecological goods and services are an alternative to current agri-environmental government programs to provide incentives for farmers. This thesis reports on a testbed of laboratory auction experiments to assess efficiency and cost effectiveness of different design treatments. These were developed using estimated costs of wetland restoration in southern Manitoba. The testbed included a comparison of payment type (discriminatory versus uniform payments), and ranking rule for both budget based and target based auctions over repeated auction rounds and reserve prices for the target based auctions. It was found that 1) uniform payments outperformed discriminatory payments under a budget constraint, 2) discriminatory payments were superior to uniform payments under a target constraint, 3) where there is no budget constraint a reserve price can greatly increase efficiency and cost effectiveness. These findings highlight the complexity of auction design and may be used as an aid to guide policy decisions and agri-environmental program design.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Buhlmann et al. (2000) studied the minettes and xenoliths from southern Alberta, Canada. They hypothesized that the minettes were derived from a source containing phlogopite + clinopyroxene at pressures ≥ 1.7 GPa. To test this hypothesis, we investigated 1) the liquidus mineralogy of a primitive minette; and 2) the melting reactions of a mica + clinopyroxene assemblage. For the minette, we found a multiple saturation point at 1.77 GPa and 1350°C, where liquid coexists with orthopyroxene and olivine. Neither phlogopite nor clinopyroxene were found to be liquidus phases. We suggest that our minette is not primary, but had re-equilibrated with harzburgitic mantle subsequent to formation. For our mica-clinopyroxenite assemblage, we found the solidus is at temperatures above a cratonic geotherm, implying that this mica-clinopyroxenite is stable in a craton. The composition of the melts from our experiments are similar to madupitic lamproites from Leucite Hills, Wyoming, studied by Carmichael (1967).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Classical fault detection methods do not completely satisfy the reliability requirement for complex and highly nonlinear stochastic systems. One solution to this problem is to use more advances fault detection methods such as multiple models to simulate system in different operating conditions.
This study focuses on fault detection and identification (FDI) of suspension strut and particle filter is used as estimator in interacting-multiple-model-based (IMM-based) structure. The main idea of the IMM-based diagnosis algorithm is that the actual system is assumed to have uncertain (failure status) parameter vector affecting the matrices defining the structure of the model. Then, a model set is defined to model each of these different parameters and each model is in certain probability drawn from model set. By calculating these probabilities one can determine the mode in effect at each sampling time and perform fault detection and diagnosis and determine the presence of a particular failure mode.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Canadian beef industry today is challenged to adapt to climate change and to produce quality beef more efficiently, using fewer resources and with less impact to the environment. Competing protein sources have integrated their supply chains and applied genetic selection to increase efficiencies dramatically. Creating vertical linkage and increasing integration in the Canadian beef supply chain may be an opportunity to meet production challenges. A practical DNA tracking system was designed and demonstrated as a potential solution for the Canadian beef industry. High throughput SNP technology was used to create links between 1,237 feeder calves from multisire pastures, and their performance records, to their respective sires for the purpose of genetic improvement. Subsequent producer breeding decisions were based on Sire Production Summaries generated for their bulls. As an added value this system also delivers DNA traceability on beef products, enabling label verification and expansion into markets demanding traceability.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Three parameter thermodynamic predictive models have been shown 
previously to provide superior accuracy in the prediction of gas chromatographic 
retention times in comparison to other forms of modelling such as retention 
indices. However, these models suffer from the need for extensive 
experimentation to generate the data required to make their predictions. This then 
limits the applicability of the method to real world situations. This thesis sets out 
to explore new methods and techniques that reduce the required experimentation 
necessary to make thermodynamic based retention time predictions in gas 
chromatography. Three main ideas are explored in the process of reducing 
experimentation: the automation of thermodynamic data collection, the adaptation 
of thermodynamic collection models from isothermal to temperature programmed 
based experimentation and a method to rapidly transfer thermodynamic data from 
one chromatographic system to the next. Along with the above stated goals, this 
research sets out to develop models for the prediction of retention times in two 
dimensional gas chromatography using three parameter thermodynamic data. Two 
dimensional separations are also used to validate the methods and concepts 
mentioned previously.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) is a parent-assisted social skills program for teens with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the PEERS program, the parents play a vital role in supporting and coaching their teen’s skill development. The purpose of this study was to explore parental experiences of participating in the PEERS program. Three families (four parents) were invited to share their experiences through interviews and their stories were crafted into three individual case studies. The following common themes emerged across the case studies: (a) appreciations and challenges of parent sessions (b) PEERS is different from other programs, (c) mechanics of skill development and maintenance, and (d) social triumphs from being part of PEERS. Collective suggestions for how to deliver PEERS in the future and clinical implications were discussed, along with the discussion on program delivery of social skills interventions for individuals with ASD for researchers and practitioners were presented.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The foremost goal of this thesis is to integrate the study of animal cognition with the field of animal personality. In the early 20th century, Pavlov integrated these fields by describing an interaction between associative learning and dogs that exhibited different behavioural types. Since Pavlov, little work has been conducted to examine how differences in cognition may affect the development of personality, the converse, or the interaction between the two. In Chapters 2 and 3 I use wild-caught black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) to examine if individual differences in learning speed are related to exploratory behaviour. Results from Chapter 2 show that fast-exploring chickadees solve an acoustic operant discrimination task in fewer trials compared to slow-exploring chickadees. In Chapter 3, the acoustic operant discrimination task included a reversal phase. Once each bird had learned to perform the correct response to two different stimulus categories, the reward contingencies associated with each category were reversed. Here I found that the slow-exploring chickadees outperformed the fast-exploring chickadees suggesting that variation in cognition and behavior may be maintained through habitat-dependent selection. That is, slow and fast exploring chickadees may excel in different environments. In Chapter 4, I used black-capped chickadees to examine if vocal production was related to exploratory behaviour. I found that vocal production was consistent over time in a control context and in a stressful context, but vocal production was not consistent across contexts. Furthermore, vocal production of the namesake chick-a-dee call and alarm call in the stressful context were positively related to exploratory behaviour. In Chapter 5, I used domestic pigeons (Columba livia) to examine the relationship between accuracy of discrimination and exploration. I found, contrary to the predicted direction, that fast-exploring pigeons were better discriminators compared to slow-exploring pigeons. Taken together, the experiments that comprise this thesis suggest that different cognitive styles do co-vary with different behavioural styles (i.e., animal personalities). Ongoing and future research directions for studying individual differences in cognition are discussed</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. As such, a vast amount of research has investigated novel therapies for preventing and/or reducing CVD. Much evidence has demonstrated the importance of dietary composition in increasing or lowering risks of CVD. While the role played by dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in reducing CVD has been recognized for many years, the protective mechanisms of these molecules, notably toward ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, remain unknown. Ecosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) are two of the most important n-3 PUFAs. Both are present in fish oil. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of acute administration of DHA on IR injury. Methods: Hearts from male C57BL6 mice were isolated and perfused in Langendorff mode and then subjected to IR injury. Hearts were perfused with different concentrations of DHA (0, 10, 50 and 100 µM) to determine its effect on cardiac function and recovery. Mechanistic studies were performed using rat myoblast cells (H9c2 cells) in an anoxia-reoxygenation protocol. Cell viability (MTT assay), cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities were measured to compare cellular injury in DHA treated cells versus controls. The impact of DHA on mitochondrial morphology and function was assessed using epifluorescent microscopy. Results: Data demonstrated that DHA has adverse effects on both pre- and post-ischemic left ventricular developed pressures and on the heart rate, systolic and diastolic heart rates. Cell experiments revealed that significant cell death occurs in a concentration-dependent manner when H9c2 cells are treated with DHA and subjected to anoxia-reoxygenation injury. Moreover, apoptotic cell death is caused by DHA treatment, during which cytochrome c is released and caspases-8 and -3 are activated. Significant mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of membrane potential were observed with high concentrations of DHA. Conclusion: Our data suggest that acute treatment with DHA impedes the function of isolated hearts and triggers apoptotic cell death.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this thesis was to construct radiation hybrid (RH) maps and estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) using high density SNP markers on chromosomes 19 (BTA19) and 29 (BTA29) and use these as a tool to detect QTL in dairy and beef cattle. We have constructed RH maps of BTA19 and BTA29 consisting of 555 and 253 SNP markers respectively using a 12,000 rad whole genome RH panel. When aligned with the third draft of bovine genome sequence assembly, there was a significant internal rearrangement of the markers involving displacement, inversion and flips within the scaffolds with some scaffolds being misplaced in the genome assembly. Many of these mapped markers (370 and 186 SNP markers on BTA19 and 29 respectively) were further utilized to quantify the extent of LD using the square of the correlation coefficient (r2) and to study the pattern of selection signatures in beef (Angus) and dairy (Holstein) breeds of Bos taurus. Along the chromosomes, patterns of LD were variable in both breeds and a minimum of 30,000 informative and evenly spaced markers would be required for whole genome association studies in cattle. In addition, chromosomal regions showing evidence of selection for economically important traits in Angus and Holstein were identified. Furthermore, the dense SNP markers were used to perform chromosome-wide scan to detect QTL for different economically important traits in beef and dairy cattle. Two approaches, single marker LD regression and Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain, were used to map QTL. QTL for 10 and 5 traits in dairy cattle and for 2 and 1 trait in beef cattle on BTA19 and 29 respectively were detected using both approaches of QTL mapping. The QTL detected in this study are a step towards the identification of positional candidate genes controlling these traits. In addition, we have detected several SNPs influencing economically important traits in both beef and dairy cattle. Some SNPs have been validated in an independent cattle population and has the potential of being utilized in the marker assisted selection of cattle.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This qualitative research study seeks to understand the educational experiences of
elementary aged children who do not conform to gender stereotypes. The study explores the educational experiences of three children who have all identified as transgender while in elementary school. The study also embeds the experiences of the caregivers as they navigate through the educational system. All participants are from the Edmonton, Alberta, Canada area, and all documents are relevant to either the Edmonton or Alberta teaching contexts. Using a case study approach, the researcher first used each family’s experience as a separate case and then brought the experiences together to represent a collective case. The data collected consisted of interviews, observation notes, personal narratives and educational documents. The data collected indicates that conceptualizing gender along the binary of male and female does not allow for the creation of inclusive educational environments for students who do not conform to this binary. Therefore it is necessary to expand the understanding of gender to create a new normativity that accommodates gender diversity. In order to create inclusive educational environments which accommodate gender diversity, those within the educational environments must recognize gender beyond the binary of male/female. To be able to break away from the dominant conceptualizations of gender, intentional support for students, caregivers and teachers must occur. Those close to the children who are part of this study have indicated that the challenges they have encountered with regard to understanding gender differently have created opportunities for significant, positive growth and change.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: Stories may be an effective tool to communicate with and influence patients because of their ability to engage the reader. 
Objectives: To develop story booklets and evaluate their effectiveness compared to standard information sheets for parents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with croup. 
Methods: A systematic process was followed to develop and pilot-test the story booklets. Parents were randomized to receive story booklets or standard information sheets during their ED visit. The primary outcome of change in anxiety during the ED visit was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, which was completed upon recruitment and at discharge. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days post-ED visit to gather information on secondary outcomes: symptoms, expected anxiety for future croup, satisfaction, regret, knowledge, return for medical care, and resource use. Telephone interviews were conducted every other day until symptoms resolved or until day 9. Outcomes were compared using independent-groups t-tests, Mann Whitney tests, or Chi-square tests.
Results: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge. The story group (n=129) showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to the ED than the comparison group (n=126) (p&lt;0.001). The story group reported quicker resolution of symptoms: median days to no symptoms 3 versus 5; the survival distributions were significantly different (p=0.032). There were no differences for the remaining outcomes.
Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence regarding the use of stories in the ED for an acute, self-limiting condition and contributes to a growing evidence matrix identifying when, where, and for whom storytelling may be most effective. Reasons for lack of significance for the primary and other outcomes may relate to choice of outcome, timing of outcome assessment, or disconnect between the intervention and needs of the end-user. Further research is needed to corroborate the significant findings and examine their underlying mechanism. An examination of risk of bias in a sample of pediatric trials demonstrates that there is room for improvement in the design, conduct, and reporting of research related to child health and provides direction for future research.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Slurry transport is a key material handling technology in a number of industries. In oilsands ore transport, slurry pipelining also promotes conditioning to release and aerate bitumen prior to separation. Reliability of slurry transport pipelines is a major ongoing problem for operating companies due to unexpected piping failures, even when conservative maintenance strategies are employed. To date, no accurate model has been developed to predict wear rates in slurry transport pipelines, although previous studies have shown that important variables include flow rate, slurry density, and particle size distribution. 

This work investigates erosion wear mechanisms causing inner pipe wall wear due to sand slurry flow in a horizontal section of pipe under steady state conditions. A corresponding lumped-parameter erosion wear model is presented based on simplification of the physics of oilsands slurry flow. An apparatus was designed and developed to measure the forces acting on the pipe inner wall to monitor forces related to erosion in a laboratory-scale sand slurry loop, and preliminary results are presented with recommendations for future work.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Bai Xianyong’s writing has two dimensions; one is “decline”, and the other is “youth”. Rooted in the fracture of historical trauma experience, “decline” stands for the last mainlander. However, the theme of Taipei People is not limited to the decline of a class, but rather “after the ending”, that is, how to face historical burden and newly establish and control subjectivity. The “after the ending” is just before the 1970s, during which Taiwan’s awakening of self-consciousness had begun. The rise of Taiwan’s self-consciousness during the 1970s did not come into being overnight. The 1960s was the period full of struggle and anxiety before the birth of the subject consciousness. In Taipei People, Bai Xianyong uses different stories to offer a multiform examination of the phenomena of historical anxiety associated with mainlanders in Taiwan. This thesis argues that the anxiety is rooted in their identity as the “last mainlanders.” During the transformative period of the 1960s and 1970s, these “Taipei people” solve the problem of how to face historical trauma through compulsively “tailing” the past. In contrast to the context of “Youth Writing” in the 1960s, Bai Xianyong pushes readers to face their historical anxiety through writing its declining years.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The mechanism by which voltage-gated potassium ion (Kv) channels respond to changes in membrane polarization is one of the most widely studied yet least understood aspects of Kv channels. The voltage sensing S4 helix contains 4-7 basic residues that form an electrostatic interaction network with the acidic residues in the S2 and S3 helices to stabilize the open and the closed state in response to voltage change. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of S3-S4 loop length and composition in shaping the voltage response of Kv channels. In this thesis, I have undertaken a series of mutagenesis experiments on the mouse Kv1.2 (V50 approximately -13 mV) and a jellyfish Kv1 channel jShak1 (V50 approximately +26 mV) to evaluate how the S3-S4 loop affects the voltage sensitivity and regulates the interaction within the VSD in two different channel backgrounds. I have mutated the S3-S4 loop by changing the length and composition and have mutated an acidic residue on the S2 helix that stabilizes the open state by forming salt bridges with basic residues of the S4 helix.  In most Kv1 family channels this residue is glutamate (E226 in mouse, E283 in D. melanogaster Shaker), but in the jellyfish channel it is asparagine (N227). I have also made pairwise combinations of the loop-mutants and the S2 mutants to evaluate how their effects interact. Our study found that the effects of the loop mutations on the two channels are significantly different, both in terms of loop length and composition, indicating that the loops affect the propensity for channel opening through factors other than simple constraints on relative movement of S3 and S4.  Mutations in the S2 residue reveal the packing of the helices in the two channels differs significantly - in the mouse Kv1.2 mutations of E226 to shorter and less charged residues creates an omega pore through the voltage sensing domain, whereas mutation of N227 in jShak1 leads to strong interactions between the effects of shortening the S3-S4 loop and increasing the size of the residue 227 side-chain, indicating a tighter packing of the helices in jShak1 than in mouse Kv1.2.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Various clinical questionnaires exist to assist clinicians with the diagnosis, prognosis, long-term follow up of a disease, or even to assess quality of life. However, any questionnaire must be evaluated for its validity and reliability before application. Invalid or unreliable questionnaires can lead to bias or outcome misinterpretations. The Pediatric Environmental Health History (PEHH) questionnaire developed for clinical use is no exception and underwent a fundamental validation step, content validity. For the first phase, a modified Delphi technique was used to collect expert consensus for the original PEHH (200 questions spanning 9 sections). Experts were identified throughout the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSUs) network and the World Health Organization (WHO). Percent Agreement (PA) is an average percent of experts rating an individual question as relevant (e.g. “agree”) per section. A PA of 90% was used as a criterion for the number of rounds required. After two rounds, excellent expert consensus for question relevancy was achieved for the nine domains indicated by a PA greater than 90%. Experts indicated agreement with the comprehensiveness of each PEHH section. A final version was generated based on the expert suggestions, consisting of 161 refined questions. In the second phase of the study, parents/guardians assessed PEHH usability through examining ease of answering questions, comprehension, and respondent burden. Pediatricians assessed PEHH usefulness for the clinical setting. After PEHH completion, 44 parents/guardians indicated good usability for all of the survey questions and were satisfied with the length and time taken to complete it. Upon PEHH review, 15 pediatricians indicated good usefulness, but were dissatisfied with its length and anticipated administration time suggesting need for a shorter version. Through these study phases, content validity for the PEHH has been established ensuring an evaluation of question/item relevancy and comprehensiveness, and usability and usefulness. A relevant and comprehensive set of questions to clinically explore environmental risk factors for the pediatric population is available for future data collection, which can undergo further validation (e.g. construct validity).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: International prevalence of ever asthma and current wheeze in adults were examined in 55 countries participating in the World Health Survey. The prevalence of ever asthma ranged from 1.1-7.9% in Asia, 2.4-7.6% in Africa, 3.4-7.9% in Middle East, 2.4-12.1% in America, 3.9-6.8% in Eastern Europe, 4.2-17.1% in Western Europe, and 18.5% in Australia. Anxiety and ever depression were strong and consistent risk factors for ever asthma (Odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.64-4.08 and 1.42-18.49, respectively) and current wheeze (ORs ranged from 1.57-3.56 and from 1.72-16.23, respectively). Female and older age appeared to be risk factors, while higher education appeared to be a protective factor for both outcomes. In conclusion, large variations in ever asthma and current wheeze prevalence were observed both within and among geographic regions, with the highest prevalence generally found in Western Europe, Brazil, and Australia, and the lowest prevalence found in Asia and Africa.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: I advance a theory of how institutional complexity of national systems shapes the fate of hybrid organizations. In particular, I investigate how various prevailing societal logics independently and jointly affect the founding and social mission focus of microfinance organizations (MFOs); a form of hybrid organization distinguished by lending to poor people, particularly women. Although the fate of organizational forms and practices is generally linked to that of the cultural frames that support them, I show that logics may act and interact in various ways to shape these outcomes. Drawing on neoliberal economics and gender inequality studies, I identify two logics, market and patriarchy, that are theoretically relevant to microfinance, globally prevalent, and variously influential across countries. I hypothesize and test (1) how market and patriarchy logics independently and interactively shape microfinance founding and the lending focus on women; (2) how the financial performance of an MFO affects its social mission fulfillment and how this effect is contingent upon heterogeneous configurations of market and patriarchy logics across nations; and (3) how the two logics shape capital flows into microfinance. Empirical analyses of these questions are based on a sample of MFOs in 111 developing countries between 1995 and 2007 and data on the funding structure of MFOs between 2007 and 2010. In addition to showing how hybrid organizations in general are affected by institutional complexity, the findings have practical implications for microfinance, where prominent groups promote market logic as a means to grow the sector and expand its outreach.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Naphthenic acids attribute to the toxicity of oil sands process water. Naphthenic acids quantification by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy depends significantly on which standard is used and Merichem naphthenic acids are a good standard. Naphthenic acids can be removed from oil sands process water using sodium persulfate as the oxidant in the presence of iron sulfate or zero-valent iron as the activator. Increasing temperature increased reaction rate between naphthenic acids and sodium persulfate. The chemical oxidation process has a significant effect on oil sands process water chemistry, especially, the pH dropped from 8.3 to about 2.4 after chemical oxidation. Naphthenic acids can be degraded from groundwater in the presence of soil using sodium persulfate with 95 % efficiency within 40 days at 22 0C. The chemical oxidation did not significantly decrease the number of total bacteria in the DNA extracted from the soil.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In financial market, risk management is very critical to a company.
However, some risks in the market ( market risk) can not be
controlled or eliminated through management improvement or
appropriate asset allocation. Thus, it is important to accurately
measure these kinds of risks.

In this thesis, we introduce two most widely used risk measures:
value-at-risk and expected shortfall. Their estimation from data is
the issue we are concerned with in this thesis. We divide this
thesis into two parts:

First, we survey the currently used estimation methods. We introduce
these methods from the theoretical backgrounds. Then, we propose
some criteria used to judge the performance of these methods.

Second, we apply all these methods to data. We use the criteria
introduced to compare these methods. This empirical study can shed
some light on the application of these methods, bringing us some
guidelines about their use in the future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Industrial development is transforming Alberta's landscapes, with largely unquantified effects on wildlife species. Open-pit mining is occurring on vast expanses, most notably for bitumen but also extensively for coal in a rich seam that traverses the province. Major concerns have developed over the status of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in relation to this and other industrial developments, contributing to the species' listing as threatened. My objective was to assess how bears respond to mining by using Global Positioning System (GPS) data from radiocollared individuals. Using movement data in a Before-After-Control-Impact design, I found that bears used mined landscapes during and after mining, selecting undisturbed and reclaimed areas over active and inactive ones. Females with cubs had the greatest home range overlap with mines. Males moved shorter distances on/near mines following reclamation. Based on field visitation of GPS clusters I developed a multinomial model to predict bear behavioural state from GPS radiocollar data. The model had good predictive accuracy particularly for ungulate consumption. Predation is an important source of meat for grizzly bears on mined landscapes, with elk (Cervus elaphus) a major component in bear diet following reclamation. Although all ungulates except moose (Alces alces) were more likely to occur on reclaimed mines, bears consumed them primarily outside mined areas, or in undisturbed tree patches on mines. Caching of food was common, especially large-bodied prey. Dietary analysis from scat showed that bears switched their diet from predominantly ungulates in the foothills and Hedysarum spp. roots in the mountains to herbaceous vegetation sown on mines for reclamation. I propose that resting-site selection can be used as an indicator of perceived risk from human ‘predation’, and show that bears select high horizontal cover for resting, bedding more during the day in foothills with high human activity, and at night on reclaimed mines and in protected areas. Because the mines had restrictions on public access, these findings suggest that bears can persist despite landscape change because they are remarkably adaptable to disturbance and food availability. However, risk of mortality is high if bears are not protected from humans, e.g., by using access management.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Asphyxia is a significant cause of newborn morbidity and mortality. Multiorgan injury and dysfunction is a common finding, mediated in part through an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. We hypothesized administration of doxycycline, a known MMP inhibitor, would improve systemic and regional hemodynamics as well as attenuate myocardial, renal and intestinal injury and dysfunction in a clinically translatable newborn swine model of hypoxia-reoxygenation.
	Newborn piglets were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation and received normal saline (control) or one of three doses of doxycycline five minutes into resuscitation. Doxycycline improved recovery of cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic arterial pressure (SAP), systemic oxygen delivery and consumption with no effect on heart rate. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and PAP/SAP were reduced, while renal artery flow index and oxygen delivery were improved. Markers of myocardial, renal and intestinal injury were attenuated with doxycycline and associated with a reduction in tissue oxidative stress and total MMP-2 activity. We conclude that in a clinically translatable newborn swine model of hypoxia-reoxygenation, early administration of doxycycline during resuscitation improves systemic and regional hemodynamics, and attenuates myocardial, renal and intestinal injury.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: While numerical modeling and coupling techniques have been continuously studied, analytical solution or proxy modeling for geomechanical coupling of the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has not been clearly addressed in the literature. Simulations aside, there is no particular study on the use of geomechanics in closed loop reservoir optimization. 
This research has been carried out to cover two major objectives; providing a low order model to work with real-time data, and also investigating high-resolution geomechanical-flow simulation to work with data assimilation algorithms for history matching and reservoir characterization.
As the first step, a physics-based semi-analytical model was proposed based on the original Butler/Reis SAGD theory. The model was proposed for linear steam chamber geometry by modifying the variation of oil saturation in advance of the steam chamber. The model was then verified with the past experimental lab test results and numerical simulation results. Geomechanics was incorporated using the classical limit equilibrium theory. The linear geometry model was then replaced by circular geometry model to better simulate the rising and depletion stages of SAGD process. For the circular geometry model, a multiplier coefficient was defined to consider geomechanics called the geomechanical impact factor (GIF). The final version of the proposed model was used for history matching two SAGD projects, UTF phases A and B. 
The application of analytical models in automated history matching and reservoir characterization was further investigated using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). For this case, Butler/Reis theory and the GIF concept were combined with the EKF for history matching the heterogeneous reservoirs with uncertainty. Using synthetic data and stochastic reservoir realizations, it was shown how analytical models are helpful in reservoir characterization. 
While the analytical solution is placed at the centre of the optimization process, the second objective of this research was explored by applying the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link monitoring data to the simulator(s). For this reason, an iterative geomechanical-flow coupling code was developed and assembled with the EnKF. Through numerical simulations using synthetically generated data, the significance of considering geomechanical monitoring data in reservoir surveillance was examined.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis consists of three separate papers broadly examining how different environmental and child variables affect language and literacy acquisition in two or more orthographies. The first paper is a quantitative meta-analysis of studies that have examined the effects of shared book reading on language, emergent literacy skills, and reading achievement with preschool children. The results suggest that shared book reading explained approximately 7% of variance in all the language and literacy measures combined. The mean effect size of shared book reading was slightly larger for the combined language measures (d = 0.77) than for the combined emergent literacy measures (d = 0.57), or the combined reading achievement measures (d = 0.63). An examination of the effects of shared book reading on specific language, emergent literacy, and reading skills revealed that shared book reading is more related to some skills than others.
The second paper examines the effects of home literacy (shared book reading, teaching activities, and number of books), children’s task-focused behaviour, and parents’ beliefs and expectations about their child’s reading and academic ability on Kindergarten children’s (N = 61) phonological sensitivity and letter knowledge and on Grade 1 word reading. The results showed that after controlling for nonverbal IQ and vocabulary, parent teaching activities prior to Kindergarten predicted significantly letter knowledge; parents’ beliefs about their children’s reading ability predicted significantly phonological sensitivity and Kindergarten word reading; and children’s task-focused behaviour predicted significantly letter knowledge and Kindergarten and Grade 1 word reading
	The third paper reports on a cross-linguistic longitudinal study that examines the environmental, behavioural, and cognitive predictors of Grade 3 word reading fluency, passage comprehension, and spelling in children learning to read in an orthographically inconsistent language (English) and in an orthographically consistent language (Greek). Results indicated that home literacy factors did not directly predict Grade 3 reading or spelling skills for either the English- or Greek-speaking samples.  Task-focused behaviour directly predicted spelling for the Greek-speaking sample. Vocabulary was more important for reading and spelling in English than in Greek. Letter knowledge was more important for spelling in Greek and for passage comprehension in English.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Currently the recovery of niobium oxide minerals from carbonatite niobium ores relies on the use of non-selective cationic collectors. This leads to complicated process flowsheets involving multiple desliming and multiple reverse flotation stages, and low niobium recovery. In this research, anionic collectors that are capable of strong chemisorption on the niobium minerals were studied with the objective of directly floating the niobium oxide minerals from the carbonatite ores.  

In the flotation of both high purity minerals and Niobec ores, it was shown that the combination of hydroxamic acid and sodium metaphosphate was an effective reagent scheme for the direct flotation of niobium oxide from its ores. Batch flotation on the Niobec Mill Feed showed that over 95% of niobium oxide was recovered into a rougher concentrate that was less than 47% of the original feed mass. Preliminary cleaning tests showed that the reagent scheme could also be used to upgrade the rougher concentrate, although the depression of iron oxide minerals required further study. 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurement results confirm that OHA (octyl hydroxamic acid) could chemisorb on pyrochlore surface while only physically adsorb on calcite, judging by the chemical shifts of electron binding energies in the elements in both OHA and the mineral surfaces. When hydroxamic acid was adsorbed on calcite surface, the binding energies of the N 1s electrons, at 400.3 eV, did not shift. However, after adsorption on pyrochlore, the N 1s binding energy peak split into two peaks, one at a binding energy of around 399 eV, representing chemically adsorbed OHA, the other at between 400 and 401 eV. The experimental data suggested a strong chemisorption of the OHA on pyrochlore surface in the form of a vertical head-on orientation of the OHA molecules so that the pyrochlore was strongly hydrophobized even at low OHA concentrations, followed by possibly randomly oriented physisorbed OHA molecules. On the other hand, OHA only physisorbed on calcite forming a horizontally oriented monolayer of OHA. The results explain the observed selectivity of hydroxamic acid in the flotation of niobium oxide minerals from carbonatite niobium ores.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) involves the motor system and can lead to dementia. Dementia incidence among 102 non-demented participants (52 PD and 50 controls) followed prospectively over three years was assessed. Cognition was measured annually using the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). Mixed-effects model was used to determine the significance of the change in neuropsychological tests (NPT) over time. Incidence of dementia in the PD group was 41.67%. The FAB and DRS showed significant. In the PD subgroup, the copy-CDT (CCDT), FAB and DRS showed decline in patients with incipient dementia (PDID). The FAB and DRS scores correlated in the primary and subgroup analyses. In the subgroup, the CCDT correlated with FAB and DRS. The NPT were useful in discriminating PD from control patients with early cognitive impairments and discriminating PDID from PDND.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Injury to the cervical spinal cord is a devastating event that results in a transient to permanent loss of sensory and motor functions following injury. Moderate recovery has been reported to occur in individuals and in animal models after spinal cord injury (SCI). One approach to promote recovery after SCI is rehabilitative training. This thesis examines the relation of reaching training with adaptive changes (i.e. plasticity) and functional recovery following SCI. In my first experiment, I investigated whether plasticity of the corticospinal tract (CST) is the cause for reaching recovery after ablation of the dorsal and lateral CST. Rats that received reaching training were significantly better in reaching than their untrained counterparts. A relesion of the CST revealed that the reaching recovery mainly depended on plasticity of the CST itself. 
    Since it is controversial whether training should be initiated immediately after SCI, I investigated whether a delayed initiation of reaching training after SCI is beneficial. I compared the reaching success of rats that received reaching training on day 4 post SCI with rats that received training on day 12 post SCI. I found that the reaching success in rats that either received reaching training on day 4 or 12 following SCI was similar.
    Lastly, I investigated whether training efficacy is declined in chronically injured rats. Since it has been shown that the inflammatory response after SCI declines, it is questionable whether there is a relation between the inflammatory response after SCI and training efficacy. In my last experiment I injected chronically injured rats with a substance that induces a systemic inflammation. I found that rehabilitative reaching training in chronic injured rats only resulted in an improved reaching recovery when the training was combined with the administration of the substance that induces inflammation (lipopolysaccharide). 
    Although there are still unanswered questions regarding the underlying mechanism for functional recovery after SCI, the results of this thesis could be used as a basic to improve future rehabilitative training strategies and therefore improve the quality of life in individuals that suffer from SCI.</etd_ms:description>

exemplified in phase transitions such as freezing, as well as the superfluid
transition in liquid helium, which occur at lower temperatures in confinement
than in the bulk. We provide in this thesis a demonstration of a physical
setting in which the reverse takes place. Particularly, the enhancement of
the superfluid response of parahydrogen confined to nanoscale size cavities
is illustrated by means of first principle computer simulations. Prospects to
stabilize and observe the long investigated but yet elusory bulk superfluid
phase of parahydrogen in objectively designed porous media are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Removal of a drop from its substrate may be gradually (e.g. evaporation) or all at once (e.g. shedding). In this thesis, drop adhesion force as a base for understanding the all at once removal of a drop from its substrate, and drop evaporation in room temperature as one of the gradual removal mechanisms are studied in details. The drop adhesion force is found by calculating the summation of surface tension forces along the contact line. The developed model is applicable to any shape drop as long as contact line is convex everywhere. The model requires the value of left and right contact angles observed in the 2-D side view images which was found using the in-house developed software (i.e. SPPF). Regarding the evaporation study, as a first step and to minimize the number of parameters, evaporation of suspended micro-liter drops is studied. Evaporation of such cases is restricted by movement of vapor from the drop surface, and not the phase change. Literature studies assume the evaporation process is steady-state and convection is small (Maxwell assumptions). It is found that none of the two assumptions are valid. However, for the range of parameters for micro-liter drops, the effect of transient term cancels the effect of convection, and Maxwell assumptions yield accurate results. It was also found that buoyancy, which is different from convection, is not a dominant factor on evaporation of drops, and the difference between the evaporation of sessile and pendant drops has a different source (i.e. evaporation modes). Uneven evaporation flux distribution along the sessile drop surface was also studied using an electrostatic analogy (exterior Dirichlet).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Transportation emissions constitute a significant portion of overall emissions inventories, and contribute to air quality health concerns. Reductions in transportation emissions can be achieved through efficient design of infrastructure, effective policy and regulation, and informed planning decisions. However, current transportation emissions models cannot accomplish all of these goals efficiently, and as a result such reduction opportunities are missed. This work presents  a transportation micro-simulation tool that resolves emissions at the link level and efficiently models the effects of traffic congestion, traffic shifting, and mode shifting. This tool can be used for iterative design studies using conventional computing hardware. The model is described in detail, and a confidence assessment tests the model credibility. Several application studies illustrate the usefulness of the approach, and a comparison to an interaction-based micro-simulation demonstrates the efficiency and limitations of the approach.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The occupational indoor air quality (IAQ) during construction plays a major role in workers' health and safety as construction activities frequently generate airborne pollutants. Exposure to dusts, fumes, fibres and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can cause health issues such as lung cancer, asthma and silicosis. The occupational exposure limits for hazardous airborne pollutants in the workplace is legislated by the Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Code. This thesis proposes a methodology to predict the occupational indoor air quality during construction activities utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM). The single zone mass balance model was used to determine the indoor pollutant concentration; the model was integrated with BIM to calculate the air pollutant concentration during construction activities. This method allows the stakeholders to determine the indoor air quality before actual construction work. A case study demonstrates the proposed methodology during a drywall sanding activity to verify its effectiveness.</etd_ms:description>

In order to survive and maintain function of their biological molecules, they have a suite of characteristics not found in organisms that grow at moderate temperatures (mesophiles) that range from the cellular to the protein level. These fundamental differences presumably present a barrier to transitioning between the two lifestyles, yet many lineages are thought to have transitioned between thermophily and mesophily at least once. Studying groups of closely related thermophilic and mesophilic organisms can provide insight into these transitions. 
The bacterial phylum Thermotogae comprises hyperthermophiles (growing up to 90°C), thermophiles (50-70°C) and mesophiles (&lt;45°C), thus presenting an excellent opportunity to study bacterial temperature adaptation. One Thermotogae species, Kosmotoga olearia, grows optimally at 65°C but grows over an extraordinarily broad temperature range of ~25 - 79°C. To investigate how this bacterium can tolerate such an enormous temperature range, RNA-seq experiments were performed on cultures grown across its permissive temperature range. Multivariate analyses of the resulting transcriptomes showed that the temperature treatments separated into three groups: heat-stressed (77°C), intermediate (65°C and 40°C), and cold-stressed (30°C and 25°C). Among the genes differentially expressed, unsurprisingly, were genes with known temperature responses like chaperones, proteases, cold-shock proteins, and helicases. Intriguingly however, increased expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport at supra-optimal temperature, contrasted with increased expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport at sub-optimal temperature suggests global metabolism is changed by growth temperature. This may allow K. olearia to play distinct roles across a range of thermal environments. 
Among the differentially expressed genes in K. olearia are genes shared with mesophilic Mesotoga spp. but none of the other thermophilic Thermotogae. Many of these genes have inferred regulatory functions implying that large regulatory changes accompany low temperature growth. In agreement with this, more genes were found to be differentially expressed at low temperatures compared to optimal than at high temperatures compared to optimal in K. olearia. Further genomic comparisons between K. olearia and the related K. arenicorallina, which has a narrower growth temperature range of 35 - 70°C, identified 243 genes that could be important for the wide temperature range of K. olearia. 
Clarifying mechanisms by which Bacteria adapt to temperature changes in isolation can inform studies of complex microbial communities in environments that experience fluctuations in temperature as well as provide a starting place to predict the responses of microbial communities to long term temperature change.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The development of tolerogens, fabricated devices eliciting tolerance toward incompatible donor ABO antigens in implant patients, is the ultimate goal of this project. This would permit ABO incompatible organ transplants, increase the donor pool for patients, increase efficiency in the use of available organs, reduce waitlist times and reduce mortality rates of patients. Stainless steel stents and silica nanoparticles were chosen as platforms for the stationary and circulating tolerogens.

Stainless steel was coated with silica by solgel dip-coating, electrodeposition, and atomic layer deposition (ALD). The coatings were evaluated by CV, EIS, SEM, AFM, VASE, FTIR, XPS, and AES. Of the silica films, those deposited by ALD provided superior insulating, conformal, and thin coatings. These silica ALD films outperformed even titania ALD films upon stressing. Silica ALD films were subsequently functionalized with mixtures of silane derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), to prevent nonspecific protein binding, and monosaccharides (MS) or trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide (TS) antigens. Functionalizations were characterized by FTIR, XPS and UV-Vis following enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLAs) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Effective functionalization allowing biological availability and activity even after incubation in blood plasma was confirmed. Microarray microscope slides were similarly developed with all ABO antigen subtypes, characterized by ToF-SIMS and ELISA, and proved useful in detecting antibodies in human blood samples.

Silica nanoparticles, including fluorescent and magnetic varieties, in a range of sizes were prepared by sol-gel synthesis. The nanoparticles were evaluated by SEM, DLS, zeta potential measurements, fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry, two-photon excitation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and TEM. Different dye incorporation methods were used for effective detection of NPs, and additional silica layers improved fluorophore characteristics. Functionalization of the nanoparticles with PEG and MS or TS were determined successful using three different methods as characterized by FTIR, XPS and ELLA or ELISA and UV-Vis or flow cytometry. The most cost-effective method involved functionalizing nanoparticles with amine, which was optimized using an assay. The amine-terminated nanoparticles were used to tether a PEG linker molecule for covalent binding of PnP derivatives of MSs and TSs.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Objective  - To assess the relationship between schizophrenia and cardiovascular disease by evaluating metabolic risk associated with treatment for schizophrenia, prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CV-RF) and disease (CV-D), and health care utilization in people with schizophrenia compared to the non-schizophrenic population.

Methods – Four studies were completed to evaluate the dissertation objectives.  A systematic review was completed to quantify the change in metabolic parameters associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents.  The second study utilized a period prevalence design to compare prevalence of CV-RF (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) and CV-D in people with and without schizophrenia using the administrative databases of Alberta Health and Wellness.  General and cardiac specialist health care utilization was evaluated in people with schizophrenia using data from Alberta Health and Wellness.  Lastly, results from the Canadian Community Health Survey were used to evaluate prevalence of CV-RF and CV-D while controlling for important lifestyle and demographic variables unavailable in the databases of Alberta Health and Wellness.

Results – Use of atypical agents, particularly clozapine, resulted in statistically significant weight gain and increases in total cholesterol and blood glucose compared to typical agents.  Having schizophrenia was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity, smoking, and CV-D compared to people without schizophrenia.  Individuals with schizophrenia visited a general practitioner and the emergency department more often, and were more likely to be hospitalized than those without schizophrenia.  Despite having a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, individuals with schizophrenia were significantly less likely to visit a cardiologist or undergo revascularization compared to people with coronary artery disease who did not have schizophrenia.  

Conclusion – Individuals with schizophrenia have a considerable burden of cardiovascular disease compared to people without schizophrenia.  This is likely a result of a number of factors, including medications used to treat schizophrenia, the increased prevalence of smoking and other unhealthy lifestyle factors, and the increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in people with schizophrenia.  Individuals with schizophrenia utilize the general health care system more frequently than their non-schizophrenic counterparts, therefore the opportunity exists for monitoring for and management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in this vulnerable population.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: I investigated the effect of energy sector development and introduced crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) on grassland birds on Canadian Forces Base Suffield. I conducted point counts and mapped breeding territories in 2007 and 2008 for Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius ornatus), and Sprague’s pipits (Anthus spragueii). I found
that Savannah sparrows favored areas with taller vegetation, human disturbances and crested wheatgrass in both years. Longspurs used shorter vegetation and in
were tolerant of disturbance. Crested wheatgrass was avoided by longspurs in both years. Pipit territories contained similar vegetation to longspurs, were sensitive to disturbance, and avoided placing territories in areas containing crested wheatgrass or trails in both years. Well sites, pipelines and junctions were not avoided by the three species. My research suggests that reducing the number of trails and the spread of crested wheatgrass will increase habitat availability for sensitive species of grassland birds.</etd_ms:description>

A total of 465 steers and bulls, genotyped for 4592 SNPs, were analysed for 16 ultrasound and carcass merit traits using interval mapping, single marker regression and Bayesian shrinkage approaches. Thirty QTL and 22 SNPs associated with traits were identified by interval mapping and single marker regression respectively. In Bayesian shrinkage estimation, 218 QTL were identified, wherein 11 of the 30 QTL identified by interval mapping were confirmed. The proportions of QTL variance on the trait variations estimated by Bayesian shrinkage analysis were relatively small. They ranged from 0.1 to 4.8% compared to 6.1 to 11.7% in interval mapping because the QTL in Bayesian approach were adjusted to remove effects of other QTL in the genome. These results are useful for detection of underlying causative QTN variants.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Ankylosauria is a group of herbivorous, quadrupedal, armoured dinosaurs subdivided into at least two major clades, the Ankylosauridae and the Nodosauridae. The most derived members of the Ankylosauridae had a unique tail club formed from modified, tightly interlocking distal caudal vertebrae and enlarged osteoderms that envelop the terminus of the tail. A review of all known ankylosaurid species, as well as ankylosaurs of uncertain affinities, was undertaken in order to conduct a revised phylogenetic analysis of the clade. Sources of morphological variability were investigated using the relatively large number of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. Taphonomic distortion can influence the morphology of certain features which were thought to be taxonomically significant. However, the cranial ornamentation of ankylosaurs can be useful for distinguishing species and genera and should not be discounted as being too intraspecifically variable. The overall shape, size, and pattern of the frontonasal caputegulae, the number and shapes of the caputegulae that rim the skull in dorsal view (the nuchal, supraorbital, lacrimal, loreal, and supranarial caputegulae), and the general shapes of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns are all taxonomically important features. Information from the review of Euoplocephalus allows for the recognition of new ankylosaurid species, synonymization of other species, and resurrection of some previously synonymized species. The revised phylogenetic analysis resulted in a monophyletic Ankylosauridae consisting of Aletopelta, Gastonia, Gobisaurus, Liaoningosaurus, Shamosaurus, and a suite of derived ankylosaurids (Ankylosaurinae). There is convincing evidence for the presence of nodosaurids in Asia during the Early Cretaceous. In the mid Cretaceous, Asian nodosaurids were replaced by ankylosaurine ankylosaurids. Modifications to the tail of ankylosaurines occurred at this time, with distinct handle vertebrae appearing potentially as early as the Albian, with Liaoningosaurus. The large osteodermal knob did not appear until the Late Cretaceous. Ankylosaurines migrated into North America from Asia between the Albian and Turonian, where they diversified into a clade of ankylosaurines characterized by arched snouts and numerous flat caputegulae. There is no evidence for any ankylosaurids in Gondwana; the Ankylosauridae appears to be completely restricted to Asia and North America.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Elevated plasma lipids are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In certain conditions plasma lipids are normal yet individuals experience increased morbidity. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with elevated CVD despite normal lipids, while in liver failure low plasma lipids may indicate increasing hepatic damage. Plasma lipids can therefore belie underlying dysregulated lipid metabolism. Islet (ITx) or liver (LTx) transplants represent therapies for T1D and liver failure, respectively, but are associated with altered lipid metabolism attributed to immunosuppressive medications; however, causative mechanisms are unknown. Partial success of dietary therapy in post-transplant patients may be due to interventions limited in scope. Regulation of plasma lipids involve absorption, synthesis, and clearance. These studies examined lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis using deuterium incorporation. In brittle T1D lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis were similar to healthy controls; however hepatic lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis tended to be lower in T1D compared to matched control subjects. Plasma cholesterol was lower and triglyceride similar in liver failure patients compared to controls. Lipogenesis was higher while cholesterol synthesis was lower in liver failure compared to controls. Disturbances in lipid synthesis may be influenced by underlying disease, such as hepatitis C. In ITx and LTx lipogenesis was lower whereas cholesterol synthesis was similar compared to controls. Lipid synthesis is therefore unlikely to contribute to post-transplant hyperlipidemia, inviting investigation of other mechanisms. Dietary intervention emphasizing fish oil, phytosterols, soy, fibers, and almonds lowered plasma lipids in controls but had mixed effects in transplant subjects. Reduction in plasma lipids occurred in transplant patients with higher baseline lipids, suggesting this intervention may be successful in hyperlipidemic patients; however the potential of this diet intervention requires further study in hyperlipidemic patients. Diet intervention lowered lipogenesis but did not significantly change 24h cholesterol synthesis in controls. Diet did not change 24h lipogenesis or cholesterol synthesis in transplant subjects. Plasma lipid response to dietary therapy was related to baseline cholesterol synthesis and to dietary compliance in transplant subjects. Further study is required to determine if cholesterol synthesis is predictive of response to diet.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The analysis of wide-angle cellular light scattering patterns is a challenging problem. Small changes to the organization, orientation, shape, and optical properties of scatterers and scattering populations can significantly alter their complex two-dimensional scattering signatures.  Because of this, it is difficult to find methods that can identify medically relevant cellular properties while remaining robust to experimental noise and sample-to-sample differences. It is an important problem. Recent work has shown that changes to the internal structure of cells---specifically, the distribution and aggregation of organelles---can indicate the progression of a number of common disorders, ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disease, and can also predict a patient's response to treatments like chemotherapy. However, there is no direct analytical solution to the inverse wide-angle cellular light scattering problem, and available simulation and interpretation methods either rely on restrictive cell models, or are too computationally demanding for routine use.

This dissertation addresses these challenges from a computational vantage point. First, it explores the theoretical limits and optical basis for wide-angle scattering pattern analysis. The result is a rapid new simulation method to generate realistic organelle scattering patterns without the need for computationally challenging or restrictive routines.  Pattern analysis, image segmentation, machine learning, and iterative pattern classification methods are then used to identify novel relationships between wide-angle scattering patterns and the distribution of organelles (in this case mitochondria) within a cell. Importantly, this work shows that by parameterizing a scattering image it is possible to extract vital information about cell structure while remaining robust to changes in organelle concentration, effective size, and random placement.  The result is a powerful collection of methods to simulate and interpret experimental light scattering signatures. This gives new insight into the theoretical basis for wide-angle cellular light scattering, and facilitates advances in real-time patient care, cell structure prediction, and cell morphology research.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this dissertation, tephrostratigraphy is used as the central method to
address issues of chronology in the late Quaternary sedimentary record of eastern
Beringia (non-glaciated Yukon and Alaska) at a variety of spatial and temporal
scales. The Palisades, central Alaska, preserves paleoenvironmental records
thought to span, with major unconformities, the Holocene to early Pleistocene
(~2 Ma). Two paleomagnetic transects of normal polarity and tephrostratigraphic
data show the Palisades are Middle to Late Pleistocene in age, with no major
unconformities. Of 19 tephra beds identified, nine are Middle Pleistocene beds
known from other sites. The Variegated (VT) tephra has a known distribution
second only to the Old Crow tephra. Reference samples from Fairbanks, Alaska,
are correlated by glass major and trace-element geochemistry, Fe-Ti oxide
geochemistry, stratigraphy, and age data to eight other sites in eastern Beringia. A
new infrared stimulated luminescence age of 106 ± 10 ka, stratigraphy,
paleoenvironmental data, and independent ages from other sites place VT within
Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, likely MIS 5d. Halfway House, an exposure of
primary loess west of Fairbanks, is one of the most studied exposures in Alaska,
but has little chronologic control. A new tephrostratigraphic framework shows
Halfway House contains a relatively complete MIS 6 to Holocene record, dated
by the Old Crow (124 ± 10 ka), VT (106 ± 10 ka), Sheep Creek-Klondike (ca. 80
ka), Dominion Creek (77 ± 8 ka) and Dawson (ca. 30 cal ka BP) tephra beds. The
Skalamælifell/post-Blake paleomagnetic excursion (94.1 ± 7.8 ka) provides
independent age control, and adds to the increasing body of evidence that
III
Alaskan loess can record subtle variations in the Earth’s geomagnetic field. This
framework places high-resolution magnetic susceptibility profiles into context
and shows loess accumulation is highly variable, casting doubt on the validity of
correlating Alaskan susceptibility records to global δ18O curves. The Alaskan
White River Ash, eastern lobe (WRe; ~AD 840), is correlated to the European
cryptotephra known as AD 860B. This correlation means WRe is present in
northeastern Pacific marine cores, across the North American continent, in the
NGRIP ice core from Greenland, and northern Europe.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Providing clean water to rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa remains a challenge. Unsanitary and distant water sources cause a host of health and humanitarian problems. A common means of remedying this situation has been the donation of improved water sources, fitted with low-cost hand pumps.  Due donor capacity and/ or policy most hand pumps are donated under the guise of Village Level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM). This premises the notion that recipient communities will take ownership of the new pump and as such will ensure its maintenance. To assist with this many donors carry out programs of technical repair training and the structuring of in-village leadership and management groups. The reality is that a high proportion of these pumps break down after donation and cease to work thereafter. Measures to redress technical elements of these failures through increased training or adequate distribution of spares has seen some success but failure rates remains high.
This has led to a call for more attention to demand side issues, focusing on the communal aspects that may influence a village to act collectively in the maintenance of its hand pump. This thesis researched five Malawian villages where the community had maintained their hand pumps for a period of 10 or more years.
These hand pumps were treated as shared resources and the literature on common-pool resources and social institutions was used as a theoretical framework. Applying these theories proved to be appropriate for analyzing the norms, conventions and forms of cooperative conduct. This allowed the research to gain insights into institutional diversity and the relationship between ‘formal institutions’, most often exogenous in nature, and informal’ or customary collective action institutions embedded within the communities.
Findings showed the emergence of three predominant themes within these successful case studies: 1) the role of leadership at varying levels and how it is embodied institutionally as a vehicle to drive collective action; 2) the contextual norms around rules, monitoring and punishment and; 3) how it should not be assumed that cases of successful pump maintenance necessarily guarantee gender ‘empowerment’, as is often touted by water development proposals.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Research in the field of incidental vocabulary learning through reading has concentrated on various types of foci. In particular input enhancement techniques such as glosses have been the subject of many studies (Ariew &amp; Ercetin, 2004; Ko, 2005; Miyasako, 2002; Yoshii &amp; Flaitz, 2002), leading to the conclusion that multimedia glosses added to reading tasks are beneficial for students’ comprehension of texts and learning of new vocabulary. However, studies have produced mixed results with respect to the effects of L1 vs. L2 glosses (Bell &amp; LeBlanc, 2000; Jacobs, DuFon &amp; Fong, 1994; Ko, 2005; Yoshii, 2006). While this area of research thus far has focused on students’ ability to retain new lexical information, their ability to use words within specific contexts has not yet been examined. 
This study aimed at testing to which extent students can understand texts, and retain and produce new vocabulary in context when reading with glosses featuring explanations in the L2 and L1 translations. To this end, 108 students in their second semester of German at the University of Alberta were given three texts, each including the same 15 target words glossed under three conditions: (1) picture + English translation, (2) picture + German explanation, (3) no gloss. Students were asked to participate in productive and receptive posttests, and finally they took part in an online chat in which they were to use the target words in context.
The results indicate that the use of glosses for new vocabulary learning not only helps students to retain and produce the individual words, but also to use these words in context. The language used in the glosses, however, did not seem to make a difference, neither on the receptive and productive tests, nor for retention of contextual information.
The results and observations from this study therefore confirm the importance of the use of glosses for reading comprehension and vocabulary learning and show their potential for material development to introduce and use vocabulary in context more successfully.</etd_ms:description>

Objectives
The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the association between geographic location of residence and recovery from work-related MSK injury in workers’ compensation claimants; and (2) to determine whether the association between geographic location of residence and recovery from work-related MSK injury in workers’ compensation claimants is attenuated or becomes non-significant after controlling for other demographic, occupational, and health risk factors.
Methods
Secondary analysis of a dataset containing information on 7,843 workers’ compensation claimants from across the province of Alberta who experienced MSK injury was performed. The dataset had information on several variables collected at time of comprehensive clinical/work assessment including location of residence, age, sex, level of education, type of work, injury diagnosis, and health care utilization, among other factors. The dataset also included compensation wage replacement outcomes up to 3 months after the clinical/work assessment. Multivariable risk factor modeling using logistic and cox regression was used to determine the association between rurality and work disability outcomes while controlling for potential confounders.
Results
Rural claimants were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) from their urban counterparts on several variables. Rural claimants were less likely to be job attached (83.7% vs 85.6%), less likely to require an interpreter during assessment (0.4%vs 4.1%), more likely to not have a high school diploma (15.3% vs 12.8%) or university degree (2.4% vs 6.2%), more likely to work in ‘blue-collar’ jobs (59.4% vs 55.0%), reported lower pain intensity (4.96 vs. 5.14/10), but had more visits to doctors (15.96 vs 13.92) and fewer visits to physiotherapists (18.11 vs 19.47).  Univariable modeling found rural residence to be significantly associated with worse outcomes (OR 1.45, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.20-1.75). Multivariable modeling showed that rural residence remained significantly associated with worse outcomes while controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 1.57, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.20 – 2.04).
Conclusions
Rural residence was associated with prolonged work disability, even after controlling for age, job type, education level, health utilization and other potential confounders.   Further research is required to explore why injured workers in rural settings experience difficulty with recovery from work-related injury.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The “Code for Officials of the Rear Palace” (Kōkyū shiki-in ryō) in the Yōrō Law Codes lists twelve bureaucratic offices held by women in the imperial court. The most prominent of these offices, naishi no kami (Director of the Palace Retainer’s Office) was held exclusively by women of the Fujiwara clan during the Heian period, most often by those who would later became consorts and bore the emperor’s children. This thesis explores the role and responsibilities of naishi no kami in late Heian Japan in relation to the Fujiwara clan through the examination of the “Code for Officials of the Rear Palace” itself, as well as courtier diaries and chronicles from the same period.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Preparedness in informatics among future nurses continues to be a major concern for employers, nurse educators and graduates of undergraduate nursing programs. The purpose of this study was to develop an educational intervention about health informatics for undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students and compare outcomes associated with two formats (online and face-to-face) for delivering this material. The intervention was comprised of two learning modules that provided foundational knowledge about health informatics and its applications that nurses use to support clinical practice. The online learning modules were delivered with streaming video presentations, and self-directed exercises. The same content was offered in a face-to-face format with case studies and guided exercises. The study was conducted in two phases. In phase one, a non-equivalent control group design was used to pilot test the intervention, assess the internal reliability of measuring instruments, estimate sample size, and assess feasibility issues. In phase two, a randomized controlled trial design was used to determine whether there was a difference in knowledge gain, perceptions of self-efficacy, and attitudes toward the electronic health record between nursing students who received the intervention through either teaching format and those who did not receive the intervention. Only 42 individuals enrolled, and then were randomly assigned to the three study groups. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, perceptions of self-efficacy, attitudes about the electronic health record, and knowledge gain. Data were analyzed using ANOVA. 
Students who received the educational intervention did better in terms of knowledge gain than those who did not receive the intervention; therefore integration of informatics education in baccalaureate nursing education is recommended. There was no difference in knowledge gain scores of individuals who received the face-to-face version of the intervention and those who received the online version suggesting that both formats are equally effective for delivering this education. The intervention did not have an effect on perceptions of self-efficacy or attitudes toward the electronic health record. The low response rate significantly impacted the study; therefore replication of this study in other settings and among a larger sample is warranted. Further refinement of the knowledge gain instrument is needed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: L-arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid and has recently been purported as ergogenic for both strength and aerobic athletes; however, the value of oral L-arginine supplementation in physically active participants is controversial.  The purpose of this dissertation was threefold: first to examine the hormonal and metabolic responses of low vs. high relative doses of oral L-arginine at rest; second to determine the GH response when L-arginine was ingested prior to a bout of whole-body resistance exercise in strength trained men; and third to evaluate the hormonal and metabolic responses when L-arginine was consumed prior to a bout of submaximal aerobic exercise in trained cyclists.  Study 1: fourteen physically active men (age: 25 ± 5 y; body mass: 78.0 ± 8.5 kg; height: 179.4 ± 4.7 cm) volunteered to be in a randomized, double-blind, repeated measures design.  Each subject was provided three treatment conditions (placebo: flour, low dose: 0.075 g•kg-1 or high dose: 0.150 g•kg-1 body mass of L-arginine). L-arginine plasma concentrations significantly increased to a similar concentration at any time point in both the low and high dose conditions, while there was no change over time in the placebo condition.  There was no significant difference between conditions for plasma growth hormone (GH), nitrate+nitrite (NOx), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or insulin. Study 2: fourteen strength trained men (age: 25 ± 4 y; body mass: 81.4 ± 9.0 kg; height: 179.4 ± 6.9 cm) participated in a randomized crossover design. L-arginine (0.075 g•kg-1 body mass) or a placebo was ingested 60 minutes prior to performing an acute bout of resistance exercise (3 sets of 8 exercises, 10 repetitions at ~75% 1RM). There were no differences between conditions for GH, GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), ghrelin, or IGF-1 at any time point. GH-inhibiting hormone (GHIH) was significantly lower in the L-arginine condition. However; integrated area under the curve (iAUC) for GH was significantly blunted in the L-arginine condition. Study 3: fifteen aerobically trained men (age: 28 ± 5 y; body mass: 77.4 ± 9.5 kg; height: 180.9 ± 7.9 cm; training experience: 5.9 ± 3.4 y, VO2 max: 59.6 ± 5.9 ml•kg-1•min-1) participated in a randomized crossover design. L-arginine (0.075 g•kg-1 body mass) or a placebo was ingested prior to performing an acute bout of submaximal aerobic exercise. There were no difference between conditions for GH, non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), lactate, glucose, VO2, VCO2, RER, and NOx. However, there was a small but significant elevation in plasma glycerol at the 45 minute time point after L-arginine consumption.  In summary, L-arginine consumed orally at rest was effective at increasing plasma L-arginine.  L-arginine prior to resistance exercise attenuated plasma GH compared to resistance exercise alone.  Lastly, L-arginine before aerobic exercise did not enhance GH, glucose, lactate, NOx, or any cardio-respiratory parameters; however there was a small but significant increase in glycerol during exercise.  In conclusion, L-arginine is effective at increasing L-arginine plasma concentrations; however the hormonal and metabolic responses are small and further research is required to examine the ergogenic potential.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The percentage of shop fabrication, including pipe spool fabrication, has been increasing on industrial construction projects during the past years. Industrial fabrication has a great impact on construction projects due to the fact that the productivity is higher in a controlled environment than in the field, and therefore time and cost of construction projects are reduced by making use of industrial fabrication. Effective planning and scheduling of the industrial fabrication processes is important for the success of construction projects.
This thesis focuses on developing a new framework for optimizing shop scheduling, particularly pipe spool fabrication shop scheduling. The proposed framework makes it possible to capture uncertainty of the pipe spool fabrication shop while accounting for linguistic vagueness of the decision makers’ preferences using simulation modeling and fuzzy set theory. The implementation of the proposed framework is discussed using a real case study of a pipe spool fabrication shop. 
In this thesis, first, a simulation based scheduling framework is presented based on the integration of relational database management system, product modeling, process modeling, and heuristic approaches. Next, a framework for optimization of the industrial shop scheduling with respect to multiple criteria is proposed. Fuzzy set theory is used to linguistically assess different levels of satisfaction for the selected criteria. Additionally, an executable scheduling toolkit is introduced as a decision support system for pipe spool fabrication shop.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are pathogens causing severe foodborne disease. E. coli AW1.7 is a heat resistant beef carcass isolate that may be used as a surrogate organism to study the survival of VTEC on food. This dissertation examines the heat and pressure resistance of E. coli and the application of antimicrobial compounds to achieve its inactivation in food.
	The pressure resistance of E. coli AW1.7 was compared to the resistance of other foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms relevant in meat. E. coli AW1.7 was the most pressure resistant organism tested. Moreover, the ability of E. coli AW1.7 to resist pressure was comparable to the pressure-resistant mutant E. coli LMM1030.
	To further study the heat- and pressure resistance of E. coli, E. coli AW1.7 was compared to the heat- and pressure resistance of VTEC strains from different serotypes and phylotypes. E. coli AW1.7 exhibited a higher heat resistance than VTEC strains; however, some VTEC strains also survived in hamburgers grilled to a core temperature of 71°C. Several strains of VTEC exhibited a higher resistance to pressure than E. coli AW1.7. Over one third of tested strains showed 3 log CFU/g or less cell count reduction under high pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 3 min. Therefore, additional treatment processes are required for elimination of VTEC in pressure treated food.
	Additional treatments were evaluated to achieve the elimination of E. coli in buffers and food matrices. Chitosan was effective in injury E. coli in imidazole and potassium phosphate buffer; chitosan, nisin and lactate combination were effective in yogurt serum; chitosan, nisin and heat were effective in apple juice; and chitosan, Micocin® X and heat had small bactericidal effects in ground beef. A combination of chitosan and high pressure was not effective against E. coli AW1.7 in potassium phosphate buffer, but addition of Micocin® X to increased killing of E. coli AW1.7.
	In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated that high pressure alone is insufficient to kill E. coli in meat. Bacteriocins, lactate, and chitosan can be applied as additional antimicrobial treatments to kill E. coli in food. And the bactericidal effect is strongly dependent on the food matrix and the preservation method. Some of the VTEC strains tested survived heat treatment and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) permitted recommendations of E. coli by Canadian regulatory agencies (Health Canada and Canadian Food Inspection Agency). More studies need to be conducted to validate the results.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Hydrogen  sulfide  (H2S)  is  a  major  contaminant  of  industrial  gas  streams. 
Amongst the various methods used for its removal, adsorption by metal oxides is 
the most promising. Copper oxide (CuO) is shown to have superior H2S removal 
capability at room temperature. H2S removal at room temperature is useful when 
the  gas  stream’s  temperature  is  low  and  in  applications  such  as  on-board  fuel 
processing of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. 
The  addition  of  supports  improves  the  adsorption  capacity  and  utilization  of 
copper species.  In this study, Engelhard titanosilicates (ETS-2, ETS-4 and ETS-
10)  were  chosen  as  supports  due  to  their  high  surface  area  and  ion-exchange 
capacities. Copper species were dispersed on the supports via ion-exchange.  
The H2S adsorption potential of Cu-ETS-2, Cu-ETS-4 and Cu-ETS-10 versus 
commercial H2S scrubbers was investigated. Cu-ETS-2 was found to be the most effective adsorbent at room temperature due to its high external surface area and high dispersion of copper species.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The overall objective is to research methods for the efficient simulation of structured reactors using models that can capture as much of the real micro scale phenomena as possible within the constraint of running in a realistic amount of computer time.  The problem of modelling a complete reactor can be visualized as one of multi-scale modelling. Taking monolith reactors as an example, at the molecular level (micro-scale) there are the mechanistic models for the reaction kinetics. The meso scale can be defined as the channel level, in which the diffusion and reaction steps in the washcoat are considered, as is the mass and energy transfer between the fluid in the channel and the solid wall. The macro-scale is defined as the entire reactor that is modelled as a continuum. The challenge is to determine a method to capture the micro-scale information in the macro-scale model. Furthermore, the micro-scale model will be based on data determined in an appropriate experimental apparatus. In this study, the use of data based models for the monolith reactor and a gauze type reactor are explored. The information for the small scales is pre-compiuted and stored in a look-up table, which is accessed during execution of the macro-model. Through the analysis of the CFD simulation, it has been shown that this method can reduce the computation time significantly with good results.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In many jurisdictions, policies aimed at improving educational processes and outcomes have focused on teacher professional learning. Yet, there is a gap in research concerning teachers’ understandings of their own professional learning as it is influenced by school improvement policies. Using an interpretivist approach, this case study of two schools in Alberta and England explored teachers’ understandings of their professional learning and the ways in which policy context interacted with these understandings. The findings suggested there is significant variability in the ways that teachers construct: 1) the notion of collaboration in working with others; 2) conceptualizations of teacher knowledge; and 3) the relationship of student learning to teacher professional learning. Additionally, findings indicated that teachers actively meditated their understandings of policy in their teaching practice, suggesting that policy context is one factor needing consideration in teacher professional learning research and policy development.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Drawing on an earlier narrative inquiry with youth who left school prior to graduating and an experience with creating a responsive summer school program for Aboriginal youth, the present study explored research puzzles into the educational experiences of Aboriginal youth and their families both in and outside of schools.  Drawing on a conception of narrative inquiry as both methodology and phenomenon (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000) and on concepts of school curriculum making and familial curriculum making (Huber et al. 2011) I designed a study in which I engaged with three aboriginal youth in their early teens and their families over 2 years.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Alberta Basin has been the subject of various diagenetic studies but the precise understanding of the processes behind deep burial cementation remains unclear. This study investigates late-diagenetic calcites from the Devonian Southesk-Cairn Carbonate Complex with the purpose of constraining temperature, relative timing and chemistry of the paleo-fluids involved during calcite precipitation. Two types of late-diagenetic calcites were petrographically and	geochemically	characterized.	Whereas	calcite-I	resulted	from thermochemical sulfate reduction, calcite-II precipitated with no or little oxidized organic carbon present. As shown by the Sr isotopic signatures, some reservoirs were exposed to radiogenic Sr-bearing fluids. A slight trend of increasing fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures with depth is only seen in calcite-I, and bitumen reflectance also increases with depth following a normal burial gradient. These results, however, are not conclusive to interpret the influence of tectonically-driven fluids during deep burial.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Abnormal death memorials are unofficial cenotaphs and burial places located in public space. They mark the sites of sudden tragic death and, therefore, include roadside memorials – an internationally spread phenomenon that is a relatively new topic in the Folkloristics scholarship. This study is the first to explicitly discuss abnormal death memorials – as both material culture objects and as objects of folk beliefs – in the context of Ukrainian culture. Based on fieldwork done in Ukraine between 2005 and 2009, this thesis identifies the meaning and significance of contemporary memorials in Ukraine through people's attitudes. The results of the study show that positive attitudes towards abnormal death memorials are influenced by Ukrainian folk beliefs about “bad death,” the afterlife, and communication with the dead. Abnormal death memorials in Ukraine appear as metaphors of Ukrainian cosmology and changing folk beliefs about the worlds of the living and dead. The practice of erecting memorials in Ukraine seem to be a modification of a century long folk tradition of marking spots of “bad death.”</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This paper investigates the three channels through which real exchange rate variations affect the economy, namely, a profit channel, a value added channel, and a labor-market channel. In this study, both aggregate and sector-level data for 20 OECD countries and a panel-version of the Autoregressive distributed lag – Error-correction model (ARDL-ECM) proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001) are used to examine the responses of real profits, real value added, real wages and employment to movements in the real exchange rate. According to the estimation results, a real currency depreciation, defined as an increase in the real exchange rate, tends to raise real profits for two tradable-good sectors, namely, Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, and Manufacturing, five of the manufacturing subsectors, Total economy, and even two non-tradable-good sectors and two service sector aggregates. However, a negative exchange rate impact on the long-run real profits of Construction and insignificant responses of the other non-tradable-good sectors are also observed. By further examining the exchange rate influences on value added volumes, I find that a real currency depreciation tends to have similar effects on value added volumes as on real profits. As for real wages and employment, a real currency depreciation depresses real wages for both tradable- and non-tradable-good sectors. Employment tends to rise as domestic currency depreciates for Manufacturing and two of its subsectors in the short run, and drop for Construction, and Total services. Thus, one can conclude that a real currency depreciation more often raises profits for the tradable-good sectors, with real value added growth plus the fall in real labor compensation explaining the positive growth in real profits. For the non-tradable-good sectors, two cases should be considered: for Construction, a real currency depreciation causes real value added to drop more than does real labor compensation, resulting in a profit contraction in the long run. For the other non-tradable-good sectors and aggregates, real value added either is unresponsive to real exchange rate variations, or contracts less than does total real labor compensation, thus giving rise to either insignificant or positive profit responses to real exchange rate movements.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Stainless steel ligatures ties are routinely used by orthodontists to improve torque; nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence as to the role of stainless steel ligation in bracket retentive characteristics. The objective of this study is to look into the effects of stainless steel (SS) ligation has on torque and bracket deformation for conventional and self-ligated brackets. A previously described torquing apparatus, combined with an overhead camera, utilized to rotate a .019x.025-inch stainless steel wire in a bracket slot to measure torque (Nmm) and acquire an overhead image at 3° increments of wire rotation from 0° up to 45°, and back again to 0°. A digital image correlation means and two profile images comparisons (before and after) were used to assess the structural changes of the bracket throughout the wire rotation and after the experiment, respectively Sixty Orthos®Twin brackets (Ormco Corp., Glendora, CA, USA), 30 ligated with conventional elastic ties and 30 ligated with SS ligature ties, and sicty Damon Q® brackets (Ormco Corp., Glendora, CA, USA), 30 ligated with its conventional sliding door and 30 ligated with SS ties in addition to the sliding door, were used.  The torque was significantly higher for the steel ligated groups over conventional ones from 3°-9° of wire rotation. Overall, steel ligation did increase torque for Orthos twin brackets but it did not for Damon Q brackets. Stainless steel ligature reduces the amount of plastic deformation of both Orthos twin and Damon Q brackets, and a slight decrease in the slot width can be evident when stainless steel ligature is first applied to a bracket. SS ligature ties can be an effective auxiliary tool that could help practitioners to achieve better torque and to reduce bracket deformation</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: One of the most stunning results of information theory is the channel coding theorem addressing the maximum rate of reliable communication over a noisy channel, known as channel capacity. In this thesis, we consider two problems emerging from the classic channel coding theorem. First, we study the extremal problems of the channel reliability function, which is the exponent with which the probability of making a wrong decision vanishes. To this end, we introduce a set of fundamental channels which exhibit significant monotonicity properties and invoke the theory of Chebychev systems to utilize such properties. We show that the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and binary erasure channel (BEC), which happen to be among the fundamental channels, are the two extremes of the channel reliability function. Also, we show that given a rate and a probability of error as a performance measure, BSC (BEC) needs the longest (shortest) code length to achieve such performance.
While the first problem is pure theoretical, the second problem addresses a challenging practical scenario. The most fundamental assumption in the classic channel coding theorem is that we receive as many symbols as we send. In reality, however, this is not always true, e.g., a miss-sampling at a conventional receiver might duplicate a symbol. The extra symbol confuses a receiver as it has no clue about the position of duplication. Such scenarios are collectively known as channels with synchronization errors. Unlike their classic counterparts, there is only little known about either the capacity or coding techniques for channels with synchronization errors, even in their simplest forms. In this part, we study the duplication channel by introducing a series expansion for its capacity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Catalysis is crucial for society in view of producing pharmaceutical agents and commodity chemicals. Industry and academia alike are constantly searching for organic transformations which can not only efficiently produce important pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals, but can also do so in a manner that is environmentally sound. During the past five years, arylboronic acids have been emerging as a promising new class of organocatalysts for the direct activation of carboxylic acids, alcohols and diols through reversible formation of boronate adducts. Such unique activation modes have resulted in the application of boronic acid catalysis toward the development of more efficient and milder protocols for existing transformations. Boronic Acid Catalysis (BAC) provides such a platform for the pursuit of “green chemistry” by providing a mild means to achieve reactions that would otherwise require harsh or wasteful conditions. To this end, several new methods employing diversely substituted arylboronic acids as organocatalysts and stoichiometric reaction promoters were developed.
     ortho-Substituted arylboronic acids activate unsaturated carboxylic acids presumably through the formation of an active monoacyl boronate species, which can provide electrophilic activation of the carboxylate group through H-bonding. Chapter 2 describes the application of this activation concept to a variety of cycloadditions and nucleophilic conjugate additions involving unsaturated carboxylic acids.
    Due to their Lewis acidic character, electron-deficient arylboronic acids exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the activation of hydroxyl groups by facilitating the complete and partial ionization of the C–O bond. This strategy allows the direct activation of hydroxyl groups without recourse to prior activation operations, thus permitting direct functionalizations in a step- and atom-economical manner. The successful application of these catalytic systems to a broad range of classical chemical transformations is also discussed in Chapter 3. 
    Owing to their remarkable binding ability to 1,2- or 1,3-diol frameworks, benzoboroxoles have the potential to serve as transient masks or organocatalysts to control regioselectivity in the glycosylation of fully unprotected sugars. Chapter 4 describes initial attempts in this important area.
    In search of a milder preparation of 2-aryl-1,3,2-aryldioxaborins, which are stable o-quinomethane precursors, an efficient ZrCl4 catalyzed ortho-hydroxyalkylation of phenols with aldehydes promoted by 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid was investigated and optimized. This methodology is presented in Chapter 5.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The intricate arrangement and composition of articular cartilage confer the structure its unique material and mechanical properties.  Degeneration of articular cartilage, especially osteoarthritis, imposes great burden not only on the patients, but also on society.  While there exist various non-surgical and surgical treatment methods, continuous research is required to overcome the limitations of current therapeutic methods.  

Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy of cartilage defects has been developed to generate replacement articular chondrocytes for the production of extra cellular matrix.   To develop a novel way of advancing MSC-based therapy, we examined the chondrogenic potential of MSCs that have undergone anti-Thy1 treatments.  Although several studies have suggested a potential link between Thy-1 and chondrogenic potential of MSCs, our anti-Thy1 strategy did not enhance chondrogenic potential of MSCs.  Furthermore, we report that a common lentiviral transduction strategy can compromise MSCs’ chondrogenic capacity, and that Thy-1 expression during chondrogenesis is dynamic in its nature.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The novel utility of sitosterol as an antioxidant in frying oils is explained mechanistically based on physical organic chemistry principles. The antioxidative effect of sitosterol is attributed to the conversion of sterol to steradiene by the 1, 2 elimination of water, which may be catalyzed by hydronium ions resulting from atmospheric moisture present at the air–oil interface. Release of protons, allylic to the conjugated diene system in steradiene, may be responsible for interacting with and terminating lipid oxidation chains.  A corresponding increase in the extent of triglyceride (TG) ester hydrolysis is further evidence of release of water in the system resulting from the conversion of sterol to steradiene. High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) was used to assess the impact of sitosterol on the extent of TG polymerization in frying oils. A reverse phase C30 column, with longer alkyl chain length coupled with thicker and densely bonded phases, was used to further improve separation and identification of lipid oxidation products. A new adsorption chromatography method using hydrated silica cartridges and solvents, acetonitrile, dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran, was developed for the measurement of polar content as an indicator of the extent of deterioration in frying oils. Concerns are growing over the potential detrimental effects of lipid oxidation products in frying oils and the ineffectiveness of the available antioxidants at frying temperatures. The potential role of sitosterol as a natural, safe and heat–stable antioxidant in frying oils is an important development for the food processing industry.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Our current understanding of Spanish heritage language development (HLD) in the English-speaking world is largely restricted to non-refugee Hispanic groups in the United States (Potowski &amp; Rothman, 2011). The present thesis addresses this gap by probing the relationship between the leftist political ideologies and “refugee culture” upon which Edmonton’s Chilean community was founded in the 1970s, and the HLD of four of its now-adult children. Data for this exploratory, qualitative, multiple case study were collected from a background questionnaire and two semi-structured interviews with each participant. The main finding was that participants’ identification with the community's prevailing political ideologies had a strong effect on their attitudes towards their ethnic heritage, community involvement, and Spanish use as adults. This study contributes to our understanding of Spanish HLD in Canada, and in refugee contexts that have a decidedly political history.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Flavonoids are a large group of plant secondary metabolites. Three main subclasses of flavonoids are anthocyanins, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins (PAs). In order to improve our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation, and their roles in fruits and seeds, we studied the developmental profiles of anthocyanins, flavonols, and PAs in developing and mature saskatoon (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) fruits and seeds, as well as in the seeds of grain legumes including pea (Pisum sativum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris L.). Levels of these flavonoids were correlated with the visual or histological localization of these compounds in the developing seeds and fruits. A biphasic and tissue-specific pattern of flavonoid production was observed in the fruits. Flavonol and PA concentrations in saskatoon and blueberry fruits were high during early fruit development localizing throughout the ovary tissues. As the fruit matured, flavonol and PA levels declined and localized to only specific ovary tissues and the seed coat. In contrast, anthocyanin concentration was low during early fruit development and dramatically increased as the fruit ripened. For blueberry fruit, flavonoid gene expression was also correlated with flavonoid end-products and end-product localization over development. In the seeds of specific pea cultivars, PA concentration peaked in the seed coats at mid-development, and then declined as the seed matured.  PAs were localized to the epidermal and ground-parenchyma layers of the seed coat. Flavonoid type and concentration varied over development, and with organ (fruit or seed), species and within species. Overall, these data demonstrate that these flavonoid pathways are controlled both spatially and temporally suggesting important functions for these compounds in these organs, including serving as protective agents throughout development.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Previous works suggest that North Americans perceive visual information more analytically while East Asians perceive visual information more holistically.  However, salient objects are also known to naturally attract human attention.  Current studies examined to what extent culture influences visual attention.  Study 1 demonstrated that highly salient objects attract passive viewers’ attention similarly across North American and East Asian cultures.  In study 2, however, we revealed that such strong tendency for humans can be influenced by culture when people actively engaged in the observation.  When participants were asked to report their observation, Canadian participants predominantly reported information regarding focal objects whereas Japanese participants also reported much information regarding contextual features.  Consistently, culturally divergent patterns of eye movements were observed.  The current study thus indicates that the active involvement in observation is especially important to understand the influence of culture on visual attention.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Reading impairment, known as alexia, frequently co-occurs with damage to the language areas of the brain in aphasia. Text-based reading treatments have been shown to improve reading fluency, but the mechanisms behind such improvement remain unclear. This study investigates the efficacy of Multiple Oral Rereading and Oral Reading for Language in Aphasia as a combined treatment for an individual with surface alexia, and examines whether eye-movements change as a result of treatment. 
Following treatment, reading rate and accuracy significantly improved on practiced passages, and improved reading rate generalized to novel passages. Generalization was also observed on a measure of spoken/written language. Eye-movements (number of fixations, regressions, and fixation durations) differed from pre-treatment to post-treatment and follow-up, although in the opposite direction of what was expected. Initial fixation position shifted towards that of more proficient readers after the completion of treatment, suggesting treatment resulted in a change in reading strategy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Cpx two‐component signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli consists of an inner membrane‐localized sensor histidine kinase, CpxA, the response regulator, CpxR, and the novel periplasmic accessory protein, CpxP. These proteins mediate a bacterial stress response, sensing envelope perturbations including damage caused by misfolded periplasmic or inner membrane proteins, and regulating the expression of a host of factors that contribute to preservation of the envelope.
While structural information exists for a number of bacterial two‐component systems, there is limited data to describe the constituents of the Cpx system. Since CpxP has no homologues of known function, we initially focused on its biophysical and structural characterization. Biochemical studies demonstrated that CpxP maintains a dimeric state, but may undergo a slight structural adjustment in response to the Cpx pathway inducing cue, alkaline pH. The crystal structure of CpxP, determined to 2.85 Å resolution, revealed an antiparallel dimer of intertwined α‐helices with a highly basic concave surface. We identified that the core fold adopted by CpxP is also found in a number of other periplasmic stress response proteins. Additionally, we proposed that the conserved LTXXQ motifs that define a family of proteins have a structural role in the formation of diverging turns. Finally, we identified several sites, including two solvent‐exposed residues and the charged surfaces of CpxP, which are likely involved in intermolecular interactions.
In an effort to understand the molecular mechanism(s) by which CpxA detects specific inducing signals, we set out to describe the uncharacterized periplasmic sensor domain of CpxA biochemically and structurally. We demonstrated that the isolated sensor domain likely exists in a unique tetramer‐dimer equilibrium. Further, we suggested that the periplasmic domain of CpxA forms a PAS‐like PDC fold, and identified regions that could possibly be involved in a structural rearrangement upon stimulus perception. Lastly, we established preliminary crystallization conditions that will be optimized for high‐resolution structure determination. Ultimately, these studies will provide insight into the molecular characteristics of CpxA and CpxP that contribute to the regulation of the response to envelope stress in pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis describes a methodology for process improvement of panelized home building production lines through increasing productivity and reducing production cycle time based on lean production and simulation tools. In panelized home building, panels are produced in a factory and then moved to the construction site for assembly. The challenge here is the high customization level in home models and also the wide range of panel types with different design properties which lead to highly variant processing times. In this thesis, a regression-based methodology is proposed which formulates the task times of different activities based on the unique design properties of a panel. The regression models are used as input in the simulation model to validate the process improvement plans such as line balancing and panel sequencing. This methodology is implemented in a home building manufacturer in Edmonton in order to reduce the overall home completion time.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Modern experience is replete with expressions of spatiality. When people try to express their experience for others, they rely centrally upon spatial metaphors to make sense of things. Expressions of being “aimless” or “disoriented” in life, “close” to or “distant” from other people, “inner” and “outer” lives, all tell us something about how people are situated in their spaces. In psychology, too, we often see spatial language used to express how an individual “navigates” or “explores” a space, without much consideration of how the kinds of spatial metaphors used express culturally specific understandings of human existence.
I propose a psychology that articulates how human beings experience inhabitation in an inherently spatial manner. I show that the spatial nature of human life requires an interpretive approach centered on expression and space. In this thesis I introduce a new cultural and social psychology based on the “expressivist” philosophy articulated by Charles Taylor and Isaiah Berlin, and exemplified in Gaston Bachelard’s poetics. Unlike the vast number of psychologies that take spatial language for granted, the expressivist arguments explored in this thesis make serious claims about the relationships among language, space and expression. I argue that the language of home is the primary way in which people express their psychological situation. 
I show how expressivism implies a genuinely cultural and social psychology that acts as an alternative to the “self-contained” conception of the individual inherited from Enlightenment philosophy. In making this argument, I draw centrally upon the expressivist concepts of inhabitation, space and expression. I show how an expressivist psychology can use the languages of space and expression to interpret how people make sense of their inhabited spaces. Ultimately, the expressivist psychology proposed here situates the meaning of personal experiences in common, moral and poetic spaces.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A paragenetic and geochemical study has resulted in the classification of the Tiger zone as a Tertiary-aged intrusion-related gold deposit. Gold-bearing mineralization occurs in two geochemically and temporally distinct assemblages. The first assemblage contains carbonate-replacement, arsenopyrite-hosted, lattice bound gold deposited from hot (~400 °C), CO2-rich immiscible magmatic fluids derived from a local intrusive body at depths of ~5 km. The second gold-bearing event contains native gold in fractures associated with bismuth, antimony, silver and tungsten, and may have precipitated from depressurization and/or mixing with cooler, meteoric waters. Mixing of components from the host-rock limestone with Precambrian sediments are demonstrated by carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes, whereas sulfur and metals originate from a local intrusion. Post-gold monazite aged 58.1 ± 0.9 Ma constrains the minimum age for Tiger zone mineralization. The waning of the magmatic system resulted in the influx of meteoric waters forming post-mineralization calcite veins.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A reliable estimate of the amount of oil or gas in a reservoir is required for development decisions.  Uncertainty in reserve estimates affects resource/reserve classification, investment decisions, and development decisions.  There is a need to make the best decisions with an appropriate level of technical analysis considering all available data.  Current methods of estimating resource uncertainty use spreadsheets or Monte Carlo simulation software with specified probability distributions for each variable.  3-D models may be constructed, but they rarely consider uncertainty in all variables.  This research develops an appropriate 2-D model of heterogeneity and uncertainty by integrating 2-D model methodology to account for parameter uncertainty in the mean, which is of primary importance in the input histograms.  This research improves reserve evaluation in the presence of geologic uncertainty.  Guidelines are developed to: a) select the best modeling scale for making decisions by comparing 2-D vs. 0-D and 3-D models, b) understand parameters that play a key role in reserve estimates, c) investigate how to reduce uncertainties, and d) show the importance of accounting for parameter uncertainty in reserves assessment to get fair global uncertainty by comparing results of Hydrocarbon Initially-in-Place (HIIP) with/without parameter uncertainty.  The parameters addressed in this research are those required in the assessment of uncertainty including statistical and geological parameters.  This research shows that fixed parameters seriously underestimate the actual uncertainty in resources.  A complete setup of methodology for the assessment of uncertainty in the structural surfaces of a reservoir, fluid contacts levels, and petrophysical properties is developed with accounting for parameter uncertainty in order to get fair global uncertainty.  Parameter uncertainty can be quantified by several approaches such as the conventional bootstrap (BS), spatial bootstrap (SBS), and conditional-finite-domain (CFD).  Real data from a large North Sea reservoir dataset is used to compare those approaches.  The CFD approach produced more realistic uncertainty in distributions of the HIIP than those obtained from the BS or SBS approaches. 0-D modeling was used for estimating uncertainty in HIIP with different source of thickness. 2-D is based on geological mapping and can be presented in 2-D maps and checked locally.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A multilevel Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) technique is developed for a 3-level 3-phase PWM Voltage Source Inverter using a 3-phase coupled inductor to ensure high performance operation. The selection of a suitable PWM switching scheme for the Coupled Inductor Inverter (CII) topology should be based on the dual requirements for a high-quality multilevel PWM output voltage together with the need to minimize high frequency currents and associated losses in the coupled inductor and the inverter switches. 
Compared to carrier-based multilevel PWM schemes, the space vector techniques provide a wider variety of choices of the available switching states and sequences. The precise identification of pulse placements in the SVPWM method is used to improve the CII performance. The successful operation of the CII topology over the full modulation range relies on selecting switching states where the coupled inductor presents a low winding current ripple and a high effective inductance between the upper and lower switches in each inverter leg. In addition to these requirements, the CII operation is affected by the imbalance inductor common mode dc current. When used efficiently, SVPWM allows for an appropriate balance between the need to properly manage the inductor winding currents and to achieve harmonic performance gains.
A number of SVPWM strategies are developed, and suitable switching states are selected for these methods. Employing the interleaved PWM technique by using overlapping switching states, the interleaved Discontinuous SVPWM (DSVPWM) method, compared to other proposed SVPWM methods, doubles the effective switching frequency of the inverter outputs and, as a result, offers superior performance for the CII topology by reducing the inductor losses and switching losses.
The inverter operation is examined by means of simulation and experimental testing. The experimental performance comparison is obtained for different PWM switching patterns. The inverter performance is affected by high-frequency inductor current ripple; the excessive inductor losses are reduced by the DSVPWM method. Additional experimental test results are carried out to obtain the inverter performance as a variable frequency drive when operated in steady-state and during transient conditions. The CII topology is shown to have great potential for variable speed drives.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare developmental disease that affects structures in the anterior segment of the eye. Approximately 50% of ARS patients develop glaucoma, a progressively blinding condition. Although glaucoma is an aging-related disease, ARS patients usually have earlier-onset of the disease. Mutations in Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) are associated with ARS. FOXC1 is a member of the Forkhead box family of transcription factors that share a highly conserved DNA binding domain known as the Forkhead domain (FHD).
Two missense mutations, L130F and W152G, which are both located within the FOXC1 FHD were molecularly characterized. Overexpression experiments in cell culture showed that both mutations resulted in compromised ability of the mutant proteins to localize to the nucleus, bind DNA, and transactivate a reporter gene. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that the L130F mutant proteins are able to form potentially protective aggresomes.
In addition, the role of FOXC1 in the stress response pathway was examined. Using human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells, HSPA6, a member of the HSP70 family of proteins, was validated to be a direct target gene of FOXC1. HSPA6 protein appears to be an anti-apoptotic protein that is only detected under severe oxidative stress conditions. Interestingly, the FOXC1 transcription factor appears to be stress-responsive itself since exposure to H2O2 resulted in decreased FOXC1 RNA and protein levels. Decreased FOXC1 levels increased apoptotic cell death. Thus, FOXC1 may continue to play a role in the adult eye by maintaining homeostasis.
Mutations in FOXC1 may compromise the ability of TM cells to respond to oxidative stress due to dysregulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as HSPA6. The TM cells of ARS patients with FOXC1 mutations may be more vulnerable to environmental stresses including mechanical and oxidative stresses. As a result, increased TM cell death may occur, resulting in the dysregulation of aqueous humor drainage and elevation of IOP, which is a major risk factor for developing glaucoma. TM cell death may occur earlier in ARS patients with FOXC1 mutations, resulting in the earlier onset of glaucoma in this subset of ARS patients.

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis focuses on the synthesis, structures, and physical properties of ternary rare-earth antimonides and germanides.  These ternary compounds exhibit diverse polyanionic substructures with classical and non-classical Sb–Sb bonding, Ge–Ge bonding, or both.  The Zintl-Klemm concept and band structure calculations were applied to understand their structures and bonding.  Electrical resistivities and magnetic properties were measured for these compounds.
The compounds RE2Ti7Sb12 (RE = La–Nd) and RE2Ti11–xSb14+x (RE = Sm, Gd, Tb, Yb), which were synthesized by arc-melting, adopt different structures depending on the size of the RE atoms.  Both consist of a complex arrangement of TiSbn polyhedra, linked to form a 3D framework with large cavities in which the RE atoms reside.  Hypervalent Sb–Sb bonds are manifested in disordered Sb fragments in RE2Ti7Sb12, and 1D linear chains, zig-zag chains, and pairs in RE2Ti11–xSb14+x.
A series of compounds, RECrGe3 (RE = La–Nd, Sm), was synthesized by the Sn-flux method.  They adopt a hexagonal perovskite structure type, in which chains of face-sharing Cr-centred octahedra are linked by triangular Ge3 clusters.  These unusual single-bonded Ge3 substructures can be rationalized simply by the Zintl-Klemm concept.  Electrical resistivity measurements show metallic behaviour with prominent transitions coincident with ferromagnetic transitions (Tc ranging from 62 to 155 K) found in magnetic measurements.  Band structure calculations show the presence of a narrow, partially filled band with high DOS at Ef, in agreement with the observation that LaCrSb3 is an itinerant ferromagnet.  With a different number of d-electrons in the M site, the isostructural REVGe3 compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic behaviour.  The doped quaternary compounds LaCr1-xVxGe3 and LaCr1-xMnxGe3 exhibit depressed Curie temperatures.
The structures of RECrxGe2 compounds (RE = Sm, Gd–Er) are built up by inserting transition-metal atoms into the square pyramidal sites of a hypothetical “REGe2” host structure (ZrSi2-type).  The presence of extensive anionic Ge substructures in the form of 1D zigzag chains and 2D square sheets can be explained by the Zintl-Klemm concept.  Magnetic measurements indicated antiferromagnetic ordering with low TN ranging from 3 to 17 K.
Compounds involving a p-block element as the second component were prepared.  In RE12Ge7–xSb21 (RE = La–Pr), a complex 3D polyanionic framework with Ge pairs, five-atom-wide Sb ribbons, and 2D Ge/Sb layers is present.  The bonding exemplifies the competition of valence electron transfer from the RE atoms to metalloids with similar electronegativities.  Full electron transfer from the RE atoms to the anionic substructure cannot be assumed.  Magnetic measurements on Ce12Ge6.5Sb21 indicate antiferromagnetic coupling.  The metal-rich compounds RE5TtxSb3–x (Tt = Si, Ge) adopt the orthorhombic beta-Yb5Sb3-type structure with a range of solid solubility between 0.9 and 1.6.  They are not electron-precise and do not obey the Zintl-Klemm concept.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Due to its unique features such as controllable power factor, controllable bi-directional power flow, and rapid dynamic response, Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) have been widely used in various industrial applications such as distributed generation systems, power distribution systems, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), AC motor drives, etc. To optimize the performance of the VSC, many control algorithms have been proposed. This thesis investigates development of the nonlinear control for the VSC in two applications: power factor control and active power filtering. A  detailed description of the dynamic model of the VSC system is presented in different reference frames. A linearization-based control scheme is introduced for power factor regulation and verified by switched simulation and real-time experiment on a test stand which has been constructed at the Applied Nonlinear Control Lab (ANCL), University of Alberta. In addition, an internal model-based control scheme is introduced to perform active power filtering. This algorithm is verified by simulation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) from the external surface of a buried pipeline is a serious matter and can cause significant economic and environmental losses. Despite of many research works which have been done on the understanding of crack initiation and propagation mechanisms, these mechanisms are still being debated. This research studied the crack growth behaviour of different pipeline steels including two types of X65, one X52 and one X80 pipeline steels in near-neutral pH environments. Crack growth behaviour of all steels has been found to be consistent with that of true corrosion fatigue. Crack growth rates were correlated with (K)2Kmax/f0.1. It was revealed that cracking behaviour of pipeline steels in near neutral pH environments is material dependent. Highest crack growth rate was seen in the steel which highest amount of hydrogen atoms could be generated and stored in its microstructure to contribute in cracking procedure due to hydrogen embrittlement effect.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study explores how bilingualism impacts lexical selection within spontaneous spoken language production.  The particular analysis focuses on the choice between synonymous verbs in English.  The main hypothesis predicts that, as a result of crosslinguistic influence, bilingual speakers of French and English will opt for the English synonym which has structural correspondence to the French translation equivalent more often than monolingual speakers, who do not experience an influence from French.  Structural correspondence exists in two distinct ways: in the form of cognates (e.g., applaudir/applaud vs. clap) and in terms of the number of free morphemes used to convey the same semantic information (e.g., lever/raise  vs.  put up). 

The language production data was generated by participants viewing video scenes and describing the action as it progressed. The frequency with which the different verbs were used was then compared across the different participant groups: monolingual English speakers and bilingual speakers of both French and English.  The bilingual group was also subdivided based on language dominance.  A range of different analyses were conducted.

A framework is established for interpreting the data.  Bilingualism can have one of three main effects on the speech of bilinguals relative to monolinguals: (a) an expanding effect, in which bilinguals use a wider range of lexical forms than monolinguals, (b) a limiting effect, in which bilinguals use a more limited range of lexical items than bilinguals, and (c) a modifying effect, in which the range of lexical items is basically the same between bilinguals and monolinguals but varies in terms of the frequency with which those lexical forms are used (a type of CLI labeled ‘covert’).  These effects interact with certain speaker variables such as which language is the speaker’s dominant language.

The stage(s) within the language production process at which CLI impacts ultimate lexicalization is also explored.  Current models of language production which focus on lexical selection are discussed.  The results of this study are most compatible with specific notions such as lexical access being target-language non-specific (see Costa, 2004, for example) and the Weaker Links Hypothesis (e.g., Gollan and Silverberg, 2001; Gollan, Montoya, &amp; Werner, 2002).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic intestinal diseases characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal area resulting in abdominal pain, chronic diarrhoea, and weight loss. IBD affects 1 in 1000 individuals and between 10% and 15% of CD patients are children (with northern Alberta having one of the highest rates of CD in the world). Molecularly, it is characterized by hyperactivation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κ B (NFκB), and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor protein required for death receptor dependent cell death (apoptosis) originating from the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) receptor (TNF-R1).  It is one of the most methylated genes identified in human cancers and one of the earliest detectable loss in cancer.  Loss of RASSF1A expression arises by methylation of the promoter for exon 1Aα (encoding the N-terminal 119 amino acids) without epigenetic loss of the other isoforms of RASSF1, suggesting selective pressure to silence isoform RASSF1A.  We have defined apoptotic regulation by RASSF1A involving death receptors (such as TNF-R1) and its downstream target modulator of apoptosis, MOAP-1.  We now define a novel role for RASSF1A in modulating innate immunity.  Rassf1a-/- mice rapidly become sick following challenge with LPS or dextran sulphate in comparison to wild type animals and cytokine analysis of the peripheral blood reveal an elevated production of NFκB regulated cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, IL-8 and IL-10) Rassf1a-/-  mice when compared to wild type animals. We propose that RASSF1A is an emerging novel negative regulator of inflammation and maybe a new susceptibility gene for inflammatory diseases.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This quantitative study investigated the direct and indirect contributions of parent involvement (i.e., the quality and quantity of school-based and home-based involvement) in children's social-emotional functioning during early elementary grades (K-2).  The sample was composed of 286 parents and 237 teachers.  Data were collected using parent and teacher reports.  After controlling for relevant background variables, the quality of home-based involvement was found to be the strongest predictor of children’s social-emotional functioning (i.e., pro-social skills, emotional regulation, and school liking), as rated by parents.  Parent-teacher contact negatively predicted children’s social-emotional outcomes as rated by teachers (i.e., pro-social skills, emotional regulation, school liking, cooperative and autonomous participation), whereas parents’ school-based participation positively predicted these outcomes.  Parent-school relationship quality positively predicted children’s pro-social skills and school liking as rated by parents, and was a salient predictor of boys’ school liking and cooperative participation, as rated by teachers.  Parents’ school-based participation also predicted boys’ autonomous participation (but not girls), as rated by teachers.  Finally, parent-teacher contact positively predicted parents’ frequency of home-based involvement, which in turn, positively predicted children’s pro-social skills and school liking, as rated by parents.  School-based participation also predicted children’s pro-social skills indirectly through parents’ home-based involvement.  Findings and implications are discussed in relation to research and theory, and aim to inform future parent-school partnership initiatives.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Brainstem derived noradrenaline (NA) in the spinal cord functions both to increase motoneuron excitability, by facilitating calcium-mediated persistent inward currents (Ca PICs), and to inhibit sensory afferent transmission to motoneurons (excitatory postsynaptic potentials; EPSPs). Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a reduction of NA, causing a loss of Ca PICs in motoneurons below the lesion and exaggerated EPSPs to emerge. With time motoneuron Ca PICs gradually recover and are readily triggered by the exaggerated EPSPs, resulting in the development of muscle spasms.  The role of the NA in the recovery of Ca PICs and muscle spasms after chronic SCI is examined in this thesis using a rat model of spasticity incorporating both the awake rat (in vivo) and the isolated rat spinal cord (in vitro).   Specific activation of the adrenergic α1 receptor with agonists facilitated Ca PIC and spasms, whereas activation of the adrenergic α2 receptor with agonists decreased the EPSPs that trigger spasms.  Both receptors were endogenously activated by a ligand in vivo, though the α1 receptor additionally exhibits constitutive activity (activity in the absence of NA), predominantly in vitro.  The adrenergic α2 receptor was not found to be endogenously active in vitro.  Use of amphetamine in rats, which causes a forced efflux of endogenous NA, confirmed the identity of the endogenous ligand as NA and demonstrated that a residual source of NA capable of facilitating the Ca PIC and spasms persists below a chronic transection.  Immunohistochemical labelling for an enzyme involved in the synthesis of NA (dopamine-β-hydroxylase) revealed that NA is not synthesized in the spinal cord below a chronic transection, indicating that the endogenous NA is not intrinsic to the spinal cord.  Peripheral injections of NA were used to demonstrate that the residual NA instead originates in the periphery (blood) and is both passively and actively transported across a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) after chronic injury.  The peripherally derived NA activates central adrenergic receptors to modulate motoneuron excitability, sensory synaptic transmission and muscle spasms after chronic SCI.   This novel finding highlights the importance of understanding the adaptations of neurotransmitter systems after injury when developing effective treatment strategies for spasticity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The phylogenetic relationships of the destructive spruce budworm group of forest pests (Choristoneura fumiferana species complex) have previously been explored using allozymes, microsatellites, mitochondrial genes and a nuclear gene, but remain poorly resolved with conflicting topologies. I used mass sampling of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across their genome in a genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Over 100 000 SNPs with greater than 75% coverage in 99 specimens (ApeKI restriction enzyme digest) or 144 specimens (PstI-MspI digest) resolved C. fumiferana, C. carnana, C. retiniana, and C. pinus as strongly-supported monophyletic species. The most distinct species, C. pinus, yielded 945 autapomorphic SNPs, and was definitively placed as basal to the whole species complex, contrasting with previous mtDNA results. The functions of genes homologous to the sequence surrounding the diagnostic C. pinus SNPs included detoxification, morphological differences, flight, and sensory perception, providing insights into the genetic basis of species differences.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Thin film electrolyte and new cathode catalysts were developed to improve the performance of proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
Electrolyte BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ; (BCZY) and cathode materials La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ; (LSCF) and Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ; (SCM) were synthesized using the citrate-nitrate combustion method, and characterized using XRD. Thin film electrolyte was successfully prepared using a spin coating technique.
Two cathode catalysts were developed: a composite cathode comprising Ag-modified LSCF+BCZY, and SCM. Chemical compatibility between LSCF and BCZY and chemical stability of LSCF in CO2-containing atmosphere were demonstrated. The electrochemical performance of the composite cathode was dependent on Ag content in the composite cathode, peaking at a power density of 563 mW.cm-2 at 700 °C for Ni+BCZY|BCZY|10 wt% Ag-(LSCF+BCZY) thin film button cell. The performance of SCM was dependent on the cathode firing temperature. The highest peak power density, 378 mW.cm-2, was obtained at 700 °C for Ni+BCZY|BCZY|SCM single cell with SCM fired at 1100 °C.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by aberrant angiogenesis, rapid proliferation, and widespread invasion through the brain parenchyma. Thus, the prognosis for these tumors remains extremely poor despite aggressive multimodal treatment including chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). The expression of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) further contributes to treatment resistance by repairing tumoral alkylation damage induced by TMZ, highlighting the requirement for alternative therapeutic options. Though MGMT promoter methylation is a prognostic indicator of response to TMZ, it has also been correlated with increased rate of mutation in GBM and phenotypic alterations in other tumors. Therefore, we aimed to identify whether MGMT may play a greater role in GBM pathology and therapeutic response beyond mediation of alkylating chemotherapy resistance.
	We determined through gene expression profiling that MGMT expression in GBM cells induced genetic alterations in several functional pathways. Of particular interest in GBM pathology, MGMT overexpression elicited a switch of the angiogenic balance towards an anti-angiogenic profile, as determined by altered expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors. Furthermore, we established an inverse relationship between MGMT expression and invasion using MGMT overexpression and knockdown models and panels of established and patient-derived primary GBM cell lines. Importantly, our in vitro data were validated in primary GBM tumor biopsy samples showing that MGMT promoter methylation (i.e. MGMT gene silencing) was significantly associated with increased immunohistochemical expression of SPARC, a well-known marker of GBM invasion. Concurrently, in isogenic models we found that MGMT expression positively correlated with increased proliferation, consistent with the well-established theory that invasion and proliferation are mutually exclusive in GBM. Of great importance, the clinical relevance of our investigations was further demonstrated by our striking finding that decreased MGMT expression was associated with increased invasiveness following treatment with angiogenic inhibitors.
	Our study therefore provides new insight into the aggressiveness of GBM by highlighting potentially novel roles for the DNA repair protein MGMT. Moreover, our data suggest the potential utilization of MGMT as a biomarker for response to angiogenic inhibitors, which constitutes an important step in developing more effective therapies for patients suffering from this devastating disease.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming more common with their main advantage of faster reads compared to hard disk drives (HDDs). However, writes are relatively slower, indeed asymmetric with respect to reads, unlike in HDDs where read and write are comparable. Current indexing structures were designed for HDDs and aim at reducing the number of reads at query time. In SSDs, index writes may impact the overall query performance in the presence of updates. Thus, we focus on minimizing the number of writes during index update, considering the R-tree in particular, given that it is an ubiquitous and update-expensive indexing structure. We propose the FAR-tree (for Flash Aware R-tree) which aims at avoiding node splits by building a chain of nodes on leaf nodes. Our experiments using real and synthetic datasets show that the FAR-tree can yield a more update-efficient index at the cost of some overhead at query time.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness
of autobiographical memories to support the improvement of
episodic memory (i.e., word recall) in patients with mild-
stage Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and healthy older adults. 
Participants included 20 healthy young-old adults (M Age = 
70.90; M MMSE = 28.70), 20 healthy old-old adults (M Age = 
79.75; M MMSE = 28.05), and 15 patients with mild-stage AD 
or mixed dementia (M Age = 74.73; M MMSE = 22.47). 
Participants were presented with three lists of 30 words,
each administered under a different support condition: (1)
no cognitive support,(2) autobiographical memory support,
and (3) semantic support.  In the autobiographical memory
support condition, participants associated each to-be-
remembered word with a personal memory that was then 
shortened to a word cue for use in subsequent memory
testing.  In the semantic support condition, participants 
associated each to-be-remembered word with a one-word 
descriptor. Memory was assessed with three recall conditions: immediate free recall, cued recall, and 
recognition.  It was expected that autobiographical
memory cues would be more effective than general semantic cues in improving number of words recalled in patients 
with mild-stage AD and healthy older adults. The results indicated that healthy older adults and patients with mild-
stage AD benefited from both forms of cognitive support.  Although the young-old group recalled more words in the 
autobiographical than in the semantic support condition across the three recall conditions, the differences were
not significant. The old-old group recalled more words in the autobiographical than in the semantic support 
condition on tests of immediate free recall. In contrast,
the mild AD group recalled more words in the 
autobiographical than in the semantic support condition on
tests of cued recall and recognition. A limitation was the
ceiling effect for recognition performance in the young-
old and old-old group. Consistent with previous studies,
the results indicate that patients with mild-stage AD can benefit from cognitive support to improve episodic memory 
if support is provided at encoding and retrieval. The results suggest that autobiographical memory cues may be
effective for improving everyday memory performance in 
healthy older adults and patients with mild-stage AD.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research explored the question: “How can we improve the implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) within a Tanzanian clinical environment?” The objectives included working with local stakeholders to identify opportunities to improve, and exploring barriers and facilitators to change. My role changed over time from facilitator to change agent, and carried with it the promise that my presence was part of the solution, and the realization that it was also part of the problem. 

The research is presented as an ethnographic case study. It draws from socio-technical and social interactionist theories in which information systems are understood by looking at the interrelation between the technology and its social environment. Field research occurred on site at Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH) in Haydom, Tanzania from March 2007 to May 2008. A two-week follow-up visit occurred in Fall 2008. HLH is a pilot site for the Care2X hospital information system. Data was collected through multiple qualitative and quantitative methods.

During the field research period, EHR implementation could not be expanded beyond Outpatient Registration. Server issues were the bottleneck and had a cascading effect. These issues identified a gap in knowledge and expertise to implement changes. But the problems went deeper still to reveal issues related to trust and power. 

The research provides insight to guide stakeholders through EHR implementation so that they might better formulate their own plans to improve the collection and use of health information. This begins with asking the question: Is an EHR necessary? Important steps are understanding barriers and facilitators for change, the influence of organizational culture and strategy, and the importance of context as these have implications for system success and sustainability. However, these lessons are not all new. 

What this research does do is tease out the influence of outsiders in the clinical environment. Reliance on expatriate resources is not uncommon within low-resource environments and leads to a convergence of cultures and strategies. This research contributes to understanding the dichotomy between local and expatriate power, and is a timely contribution to existing, but limited, research studies on EHR implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:subject>BSE, Canadian Beef Industry, Social Amplification of Risk Framework, risk perceptions, consumer, producer</etd_ms:subject>
                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this study the dynamics of risk perceptions about BSE held by Canadian consumers and cow-calf operators are evaluated. Since the BSE outbreak in 2003, Canadian consumers and cow-calf operators may have had various different reactions to BSE. These reactions may be related to their different levels of risk perception about BSE, risk perceptions which may have evolved over time and may be affected by BSE media information. These reactions may also be the result of factors other than BSE. An analysis of behavioural models of consumers and cow-calf producers is required to reveal the impacts of both BSE risk perceptions and non-BSE related factors. 
    In this study, the risk perceptions about BSE are specified applying a Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) and a Prospective Reference Theory (PRT), and evaluated through market observed behaviour of Canadian consumers and cow-calf producers, an approach which is different than the traditional stated preference approach to eliciting risk perception measures. Parametric and non-parametric structural break tests associated with the BSE outbreak (May 2003) are employed to evaluate changes in consumers or cow-calf operators’ behaviour. 
    The results show that SARF is supported by both panel data and time series data on Canadian consumers and cow-calf producers, suggesting that their risk perceptions about BSE are amplified by both the quantity and quality of BSE information. Risk perceptions about BSE have led to a decrease in beef demand and an increase in slaughter cow supply, which in turn, exacerbated losses in Canadian beef sector.
    Structural break tests related to the BSE outbreak in May 2003 confirm changes in both consumers’ and cow-calf producers’ behaviour. Consumers with different profiles had different levels of risk perceptions about BSE and different demand and substitution elasticities. Cow-calf producers from different regions also had different levels of risk perceptions about BSE and different supply elasticities, suggesting the need for more analysis of market segmentation. Simulation analyses over the North American beef sector further confirmed the impact of BSE risk perceptions of Canadian consumers and cow-calf producers in the North American beef and live cattle market.    </etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis explores the phonetic features, morphological classification, and discourse function of Chinese Internet homophones based on the Leiden Weibo Corpus (a corpus of Chinese micro-blogging). The analyses show that more than half of the Chinese Internet homophones in the data retain the same pronunciation as their base words, while the rest differ in initials, finals, or tones. Based on their morphological structure, Chinese Internet homophones are categorized into Chinese character homophones, alphabet homophones, numeric letter homophones, and blending homophones. An examination of the data shows that Chinese character homophones and alphabet homophones are used much more frequently than numeric letter homophones and blending homophones. This study also explores the discourse function of Chinese Internet homophones from the perspective of systemic functional grammar. Chinese Internet homophones are used to achieve grammatical cohesion (conjunction, reference, ellipsis, and substitution) and lexical cohesion (repetition, synonymy/antonymy, hyponymy/meronymy, and collocation) in micro-blogging. Finally, the motivations for the use of Chinese Internet homophones are discussed. This study contributes to our understanding of the dynamic development and functions of homophonic puns in Chinese Internet language.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Indices of Biological Integrity (IBIs) estimate the biological condition of an ecosystem by measuring biological metrics that predict underlying environmental stress.  I evaluated the use of IBIs developed from 5 biotic communities at 81 semi-permanent/permanent natural and constructed wetlands.  Wet meadow vegetation (R2 = 0.67) and songbirds (R2 = 0.59) were consistently sensitive to environmental stress and were strong surrogates of one another (R2 = 0.56), suggesting that plants can be used to predict songbird integrity and vise versa.  Other plant and bird communities were not good indicators of environmental stress.  A subset of 45 sites was resampled to evaluate the sensitivity of the wet meadow vegetation IBI to plant community changes between dry and wet conditions.  Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) revealed that IBI scores were fairly insensitive to plant community changes from relatively dry to wet conditions.  These results suggest that plant-based IBIs are in fact effective at measuring ecosystem health in the Aspen Parkland.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Asthma is a common chronic condition in Canadian adolescents. Stress is a proposed risk factor for asthma development. Allostatic load (AL) is a composite measure of chronic stress exposure, and its role in the development of asthma in adolescents was the focus of this thesis. In study 1, we found a significant positive association between high AL and prevalent/incident asthma in adolescent boys, but not girls. Subsequently, in study 2, the effects of individual biomarkers that comprise AL index and their associations with asthma were evaluated. In boys, a combination of total cholesterol and cortisol predicted non-atopic asthma, whereas total cholesterol and blood pressure predicted atopic asthma. In girls, fasting insulin levels predicted non-atopic asthma. In summary, we demonstrated that sub-clinical levels of biomarkers increase the risk of asthma. These findings highlight simple measures of modifiable risk factors can be used by clinicians to predict asthma in adolescents.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: During the last decade, Canada experienced unequal economic growth. As result, the Canadian government expanded its Temporary Foreign Worker Program, which led to an essential change of its purpose, making it easier for employers to recruit temporary foreign workers for low-skilled jobs. In practice, TFWs are quite vulnerable without access to the same rights and privileges as Canadian citizens or permanent residents. 
The purpose of this thesis is to analyze whether the Canadian government respects the rights of TFWs through its domestic regulations and if such laws protect the rights of TFWs in practice. The thesis goal is to determine if the economic interest of the Canadian government and employers can be matched with international migrant rights’ standards. It investigates international standards related to the protection of human rights, including covenants, international treaties, and human rights committees. This thesis also discusses similar programs governing TFWs in America, Germany, and Australia.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Social constructivist approaches to teaching and learning emphasize the interdependence and interrelationship of social and individual processes in the co-construction of knowledge, meaning, and understanding.  Although theorists and educators agree that teacher education programs must support preservice teachers’ development as social constructivist educators, few studies have been done to understand how this might occur.  This study focused on the ways in which three preservice teachers, engaging both individually and socially with social constructivist theory, developed towards being social constructivist educators.  Pedagogical understanding was socially constructed through a methodology and study design that allowed for reflection and immersion in social constructivist theory as well as practical teaching time. 
Drawing upon the central tenets of Vygotskian genetic development theory which informs contemporary conceptions of social constructivism, this study examined epistemological and pedagogical growth in three preservice teachers.  The preservice teachers engaged with the principles of social constructivism as ‘theoretical concepts’ appropriated through learning in their zone of proximal development.  Evidence of appropriation was seen through onsite teaching events and in their pedagogical approach to classroom teaching.  Data sources for this study included participant-generated response journals, researcher-kept field notes of onsite teaching events, and transcripts of post-teaching debriefings and whole-group conversations.  The data was analyzed thematically and presented in chronological order.
Three main findings arose from the study.  The first finding showed that the preservice teachers’ epistemological stance played a significant role, not only in their practice, but in how they appropriated concepts and developed pedagogy.  The second finding demonstrated that the preservice teachers’ use of social constructivist pedagogy in their onsite teaching classroom was essential to the development of their knowledge and experience; preservice teachers’ partial but ongoing appropriation of social constructivist concepts was linked to their partial, yet increasing use of social constructivist pedagogy in their classrooms.  The third set of findings were linked to the kinds of supports preservice teachers found valuable as they worked to appropriate difficult social constructivist concepts.  Immediate feedback and conversations with a teacher educator acting as a more knowledgeable other, practical field experience with teaching from a social constructivist stance, and opportunities to discuss with learning peers the challenges of learning a new way of teaching were cited as the most critical supports a teacher educator could provide.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Traditionally, constrained sequence coding has been employed exclusively in codes using binary or multilevel signalling.  This thesis extends the procedure for constructing DC-free constrained sequence codes to alphabets that use signalling constellations with complex-valued symbols.  In particular, the codes are separated into two types: i) constraints with independent logical signalling dimensions and ii) constraints using dependent logical signalling dimensions.  In both cases, constraint modelling for the purpose of the evaluation of capacity is explored.  Within the case of dependent signalling dimensions, the state machines can contain a finite or an infinite number of states, depending on the signalling constellation that is used.  Evaluation of capacity of these types of constrained systems is considered in detail.

Building upon the capacity analysis and constraint modelling techniques, DC-free codes using complex-valued signalling constellations are constructed.  The three constellations that are considered in detail in this thesis are quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 8 phase shift keying (PSK), and 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).  A number of codes have been constructed for each of the three types for various RDS spans.  Further, it is shown that Justesen's relationship for codes using binary-valued symbols, which relates the value of the sum variance to the width of the spectral notch around DC, also holds for codes using complex-valued symbols.

To complete the code construction procedure for DC-free codes using complex-valued signalling alphabets, which involves state-based encoding and decoding, an algorithm was developed to construct codes that can be decoded at the receiver without requiring state information.  This algorithm was designed to execute in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input and to be both general and flexible, so that it can operate on any family of constrained sequence codes.  In addition to codes with complex-valued symbols, a number of binary DC-free RLL block codes are constructed using this algorithm, achieving the maximum possible code rates with codeword lengths less than 20.  This algorithm is also extended to include the principles of weakly constrained coding.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Use Case modeling has been constantly gaining popularity as the technique of choice for eliciting and documenting functional requirements. The deployment of Use Case models in industry has resulted in many positive experience reports being published. The inclusion of Use Case modeling into the Unified Modeling Language (UML) (OMG 2005) has aided its widespread use in industry, especially within the object-oriented community. 
	One of the most attractive aspects of Use Case modeling is its technical simplicity, allowing stakeholders with differing backgrounds, to have a common understanding of the requirements. This technical simplicity can be deceptive, as many modelers create models that are incorrect, inconsistent, and ambiguous and contain restrictive design decisions. In Use Case driven development processes, Use Case models are used to drive the design and test phases. While a number of techniques have been proposed to develop test cases from Use Case models, these techniques tend to suffer from two major shortcomings. The techniques are technically too complex to be effectively used by its potential users (business analysts and customers); and the inability to use these techniques in the early stages of development.
	This thesis describes work tackling these deficiencies. Support for developing higher quality Use Case models is achieved by developing a modeling syntax that ensures consistency when constructing Use Case models. A controlled experiment was performed to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of using the modeling syntax. In addition, a technique based on utilizing antipatterns to detect potentially defective areas in Use Case models was developed. The technique prompts modelers to revise and remedy poor design decisions, yielding superior quality models. Finally, a framework was developed, which utilizes Use Case models, to develop acceptance tests. The framework was designed to account for the technical abilities of its potential users.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Christian Science is one of several religious groups with doctrines that suggest that medical use hinders spiritual development and/or is ineffective.  Because of the beliefs, Christian Science has faced controversy in both Canada and the United States, and experiences difficulty maintaining a committed following.  In some cases, Scientists who choose to rely on Christian Science risk increased pain or death for themselves or their children.  This study seeks to identify the influences that Scientists face when deciding upon a healthcare option for themselves and their children.  I applied interpretative phenomenological analysis to eleven interviews with current Canadian Scientists and one interview with a former Scientist.  In addition, I analyzed biographies, church policies and doctrines, Canadian laws, and relevant court cases to contextualize my data.  I concluded that Scientists use diverse forms of healthcare (some of which may be risky).</etd_ms:description>

The main focus of this work is an analysis of image representation methods leading to better image classification scores. This study applies different feature descriptors and image segmentation techniques of image depiction, and investigates their influence on the classification results. We have proposed a number of single and ensemble classification approaches. For single classification approaches, we have considered different segmentation-based techniques of image processing, with weight-based strategies showing the most promising outcomes. In the case of ensemble-based classification algorithms we have investigated multiple criteria of importance focusing on ranking of candidates, as well as on segments and features sorted based on their prominence. We assessed and compared experimental results obtained for the FERET database. The most significant experimental results have been obtained for weighted-based strategy for single classification.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Allograft tissue is used to reconstruct cardiac birth defects but induces an immune response resulting in allo-sensitization. Decellularization reduces the immune response, however, acellular vascular tissue is thrombogenic. In-vitro endothelialization may attenuate thrombogenicity. Here we offer our work, which determines a novel method of endothelial cell attachment using Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid (RGD) peptides. 
We show that an RGD-FITC peptide can be bound to a decellularized ovine cardiac scaffold. RGD modification increases HUVEC cell adhesion to the surface at 3 days of static incubation in-vitro compared to decellularized tissue alone. Repetition using a decellularized human scaffold shows similar results. Cleavage of the potentially immunogenic FITC label retains our RGD peptide. 
In summary, we determine that decellularized allografts show enhanced HUVEC cell adhesion when modified with an RGD peptide under static conditions. This may increase cell retention in-vivo leading to a decellularized cardiac allograft repopulated with functional autologous cells from the recipient.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation begins by providing an overview of Canadian agriculture policy during
the first half of the twentieth century. It examines the origins of railway transportation
subsidies, farm income subsidies, and the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), policy
instruments that became structural features of the agricultural industry on the prairies. It
then analyzes the structural pressures that led governments to rethink these features
beginning in the 1970s, and the demographic and political context in which farmer
support for collective institutions was eroded and neoliberal farm groups came to
influence public policy over the decades that followed. Subsequent chapters examine the
way that the federal government attempted to reform farm income subsidies in the 1990s
and 2000s, in order to adhere to newly established international trade rules, and the
relative success of those efforts. Two chapters are then devoted to the political struggle
between the neoliberal and collectivist coalitions (farm groups, opposition parties, and
governments) over the future of the CWB’s single desk. The second of these chapters
focuses on the final political struggle that occurred once the Harper Conservatives won a
majority government in 2011, and how the single desk was finally brought to an end.
Two concluding chapters then examine the new politics that has emerged around issues
pertaining to food security, food safety, and environmental sustainability in Canada, how
these issues affect, but often fail to intersect with, the continuing debates about the future
of Canadian farming. The dissertation ends by exploring ways that prairie farmers might
make connections to these issues, and with the groups working on them, in order to
ensure their involvement in the future of agri-food policy in Canada.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A coronary angiogram (CATH) is the diagnostic tool used to visualize the coronary arteries of a person’s heart.  These arteries can be accessed through the radial artery.  Various methods of applying compression to the radial puncture site have been used, but no research has been done to show what best practice is.   
The purpose of this pilot study was to compare two devices and three methods for achieving hemostasis after a transradial angiogram while assessing vascular complications and time endpoints.  
A mechanical device (Terumo TR wristband) and a hydrophilic wound dressing (Clo-Sur P.A.D.) were used.  The Terumo band was studied twice, using the current method and a fast-release method. 
Taking into account the small sample size of this pilot study, statistically significant differences are seen in time to discharge in the fast-release Terumo and Clo-Sur P.A.D. groups, as compared with the control Terumo group, without increasing vascular complications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The dawn of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980 was received with high hopes and expectations by the people but after twenty years of black majority rule, the crisis of the post-colonial condition, well documented in other African countries began to be repeated in Zimbabwe. After experimenting with Western projects of development and neoliberal globalization, Zimbabwe, and specifically higher education institutions such as the University of Zimbabwe became embroiled in a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The purpose of this study was to explore and understand how the processes of ZANU PF nationalism and neoliberal globalization have contributed towards the crisis in higher education in Zimbabwe. The study also sought to elaborate on some possible responses to the crisis in higher education, especially in relation to necessary and renewed policy directions.										A critical interpretive study of the University of Zimbabwe, informed by critical colonial theoretical perspectives, was undertaken to explore the crisis based upon the views of twenty participants including students, faculty members, administrators and a government official. Purposive sampling was used to select participants who were engaged in semi-structured audio-taped interviews. Documents about higher education (ministry, university and student union) were consulted to gain insight into the crisis. Contextual observations and participant observations at meetings also informed the research. Data were analyzed using the method of constant comparative analysis. 							The study reveals that ZANU PF authoritarian nationalism is exerted through the centralized power invested in the vice-chancellor’s office and the subsequent random use of campus and state security forces against students and faculty. Privatization of amenities and dollarization were observed to be the two main neoliberal policy measures contributing towards the crisis at the institution. High levels of student poverty, massive faculty exodus from the institution and violence characterized the impact of ZANU PF nationalism and neoliberal globalization. The study demonstrated how ZANU PF nationalism and neoliberal globalization are contributing towards the crisis at the institution and recolonizing the people of Zimbabwe. The conclusions derived from this research, though specific to the University of Zimbabwe, have implications for other institutions of higher learning in Zimbabwe and in other African countries experiencing similar challenges.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Exploring whether, and to what extent, the poetry of T.S. Eliot and Rainer Maria Rilke can facilitate mystical poetic experiencing is the purpose of this thesis. In opposition to Reuven Tsur’s claim that readers simply recognize or detect elements that can be identified as mystical, I argue that readers can experience, in powerfully embodied ways, aspects of mysticism such as wonder, reverence, and a dissipation of the boundaries of the self.
In Chapter 1, after defining mysticism, and illustrating the features of Eliot and Rilke’s poetry that afford the possibility for mystical experience, I present the empirical methodology employed in this project, and the traditional resistance to such methods. Chapter 2 comprises the theoretical heart of the thesis. Here, I discuss aesthetic theories of emotion, and argue for a contemporary, embodied version of expression theory informed by phenomenology. This lays the theoretical groundwork for the elaboration of an experiencing model, which is progressively developed into a model of reading experiencing, and finally a model of mystical poetic experiencing.
Chapter 3 is the empirical centre of the thesis, wherein I present two studies of actual readers. Study One, a large-scale investigation of 20 Rilke and Eliot selections, allows me to uncover seven distinct kinds of reading experience. One of these, Spiritual Enactive Engagement, confirms that a kind of mystical poetic experiencing is indeed possible in poetic encounters with Rilke and Eliot. Study Two is a small-scale, in-depth, interview-based exploration of one Rilke and one Eliot text. It more fully articulates what aspects of the poetic texts, and what characteristics of the participants, make mystical poetic experiencing possible. 
Finally, Chapter 4 is a concluding application of the mystical poetic experiencing model to Rilke and Eliot’s poetry. This application is my presentation, or my reading, of the reader commentaries provided in Study Two. I use participant comments to construct a detailed, fully embodied reading of two texts, demonstrating the potential value of such empirical research to literary scholarship more broadly considered.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This exploratory case study examines the proposition that development NGOs are playing an active part in the de-politicization of Palestinian women's movements fight for independence and liberation from occupation by advancing the “development project’s” (McMicheal, 1996) push for Western conceptions of democratisation and modernisation as being the key to economic and social development of Palestinian society, while disregarding the current state of occupation (Jad, 2003). The application  of Third World feminist perspectives allows for the examination of  structural and systemic forms of oppression that encourage women’s struggles and names ways that women have taken action to make positive libratory social change in the face of systems of domination such as capitalism and western-led international development. Education and knowledge production are implicated in this process of NGO-led de-politicization (NGO-ization) of Palestinian women’s movements.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis is an analysis of Wajdi Mouawad’s Incendies, the second play in his tetralogy Le Sang des promesses. It is the stories of multiple journeys of self-discovery taken by characters seeking to better understand their own history and present identity as it exists within a complex and continually shifting socio-political web. Through the lenses of Postcolonial and Trauma theory, I endeavor to do a close reading of the play script as well as semiotic investigation of Mouawad’s original staging of the production in comparison with Richard Rose’s mise en scène of the play in English, Scorched. I will demonstrate in this thesis that the techniques suggested by Postcolonial and Trauma theorists for the re-establishment of identity in the face of loss are exemplified in Incendies, both in the fictional world of the play and its reception by an audience.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in the proper folding, maturation and quality control of newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins. The ER contains molecular chaperones and unique enzymes that assist in protein folding and catalyze co- and post-translational modifications. The two homologous ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin are key components of the quality control in the secretory pathway. These chaperones are also involved in mediating interactions between newly synthesized proteins and ERp57, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase catalyzing disulfide bond formation and isomerization. Deletion of calreticulin or ERp57 in mice leads to an early death in utero, surprisingly, deficiency in calnexin is not embryonic lethal and results in a phenotype that includes alterations in morphology of myelin of peripheral and central nervous systems. Two important glycoproteins of compact peripheral myelin that are involved in its formation and maintenance are P0 and PMP22. Many of the mutations within P0 and PMP22 genes are associated with human hereditary neuropathies. In this study we created calreticulin-, ERp57- and calnexin-deficient cell lines stably expressing myelin glycoproteins and used them to investigate the role of ER chaperones calnexin, calreticulin and ERp57 in expression, cellular trafficking, proper folding and function of myelin specific glycoproteins. 
We showed novel interaction between P0 and calnexin as well as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and calnexin. Moreover, we investigated cellular trafficking of myelin glycoproteins and discovered that P0, PMP22 and MOG localize to the plasma membrane in all cell types tested. However, the adhesive function of P0 and PMP22 was compromised in the absence of calnexin or ERp57. Limited trypsin digestion of PMP22 and P0 revealed that the cell surface targeted myelin proteins were misfolded when expressed in calnexin- or ERp57-deficient cells. We also show that expression of myelin glycoproteins in the absence of ER chaperones does not induce endoplasmic reticulum stress.
Research presented in this thesis highlights the diversity of the roles of ER chaperones calnexin, ERp57 and calreticulin in the maturation of major myelin glycoproteins.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The focus of this dissertation is the development of Erbium doped fiber laser sources for applications in dual pulse LIBS and hydrocarbon sensing in the oil industries. A single channel laser source suitable for the dual pulse LIBS is built and characterized which required both a higher energy ablation pulse and a second narrow linewidth resonant excitation pulse in the near UV wavelength range. For this source a two stage double pass erbium doped fiber amplifier is used to amplify the narrow linewidth laser pulse input from a DFB laser diode. The input pulse with the energy of 0.4 nJ is amplified to 4 μJ in the first stage amplifier and then is further amplified up to an energy of 50 μJ in a second stage amplification. The second stage amplification is carried out with the help of large mode area Er/Yb codoped fiber. The first and second stages of the amplification were thoroughly characterized by studying various parameters under different pump conditions. The frequency upconversion of the amplified laser pulse is carried out with the help of PPLN (frequency doubled) and BBO crystal (frequency quadrupled). The pulse energies of about 50 μJ for the fundamental pulse      (1543 nm), 15 μJ frequency doubled (771.5 nm) and 1 μJ frequency quadrupled (385.7 nm) are achieved. The nonlinear effect of stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) was observed and a suitable operating regime was established to avoid deleterious effects of SBS. 
 A fiber sensor based on the on the principle of Optical Low Coherence Reflectometry (OLCR) was developed based on a low coherence ASE Erbium fiber source. The system was characterized in detail and was tested in the determination of the refractive index and physical thickness of a few liquid hydrocarbon samples e.g. hexane and chloroform, at the bottom of an industrial high pressure test cell.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Solids suspension in stirred tanks has many applications in industry. The contributions of this thesis are particularly interesting for applications in mineral processing and nuclear waste clean up. The main issue in design of mixing tanks for such applications is the gap between industry and research. These applications involve mixtures of solids at high solids loadings; however, research has been limited to unimodal slurries at low solids loadings. This limitation is a result of the complexity of solids suspension. The fundamental understanding of solids suspension has not been fully established, and the effect of numerous parameters is not fully understood. The objective of this thesis is to contribute to the fundamental understanding of solids suspension, and provide a bridge between research and industry with improved design methods.  
To provide this bridge, first a thorough experimental study was conducted and the behaviour of mixtures of solids at high solids loadings was investigated. The effect of the ratio of the particle size, particle density and solids loadings of the two solid phases in binary mixtures was analyzed. The total solids loading of the mixtures was increased up to that of industrial cases. The findings were discussed and the validity of general design heuristics was tested. Based on these findings additional data was collected and a deeper analysis was done to obtain a model for predicting mixture just suspended speed. The analysis showed that the current design heuristic that is used in industry is incapable of predicting physics behind solids suspension. A new model, based on the power required to suspend each solids fraction, showed accurate predictions up to high solids loadings. This study also revealed necessary improvements to the Zwietering correlation for predicting unimodal slurry just suspended speed.
While these studies targeted solving an industrial problem, another study was carried out to enhance the fundamental understanding of solids suspension. Solids suspension mechanisms in stirred tanks were investigated. An analogy between slurry pipeline flow and river sediment transport suggested that similar mechanisms apply in all three geometries. In this study the active solid suspension mechanisms in a stirred tank were defined, and the effect of geometry on the dominant solid suspension mechanism was investigated.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a very devastating liver neoplasm, whose incidence is increasing worldwide. CCA is often diagnosed in its late stages, and the treatment options for this disease are restricted to surgical resection and liver transplantation.
Our group demonstrated that fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC) plays a significant role in the development of the bile duct. Furthermore, FPC expression was detected in infantile cholangiopathies as well as in adult CCA.
This thesis demonstrates the presence of differential abnormal expression and localization patterns of cell adhesion molecules in the CCA cell lines, which was not associated with FPC expression. Furthermore, this data supports that FPC is an essential growth factor for CCA cells.
Although much remains to be elucidated, the data presented in this thesis may represent a step forward for investigating the intracellular mechanisms that underline the development of CCA, hence providing insight into future therapeutic options for CCA.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: As the demand for oil and gas resources increases pipeline construction pushes further into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Consequently, these buried pipelines suffer much harsh environmental and complex loading conditions. Moreover, to increase the transporting efficiency, larger size pipes and higher operation pressure are used more frequently. Therefore, these conditions increase the risk of pipeline failure, especially local buckling (wrinkling) failure. To prevent the buried pipes from buckling failure, an automatic warning system for continuously monitoring pipeline buckling is needed. A method to achieve this
purpose was studied and presented here.
The research program is divided into three phases. In the first phase, a literature review has concluded that it is feasible to detect pipe wrinkling by monitoring the signatures of distributed strains and curvatures along a buried pipe and by using the distributed strain sensory systems in a structural health monitoring (SHM)system. Subsequently, the test results and the field strain distribution data were used to verify the viability of using distributed strain sensors for early detecting
wrinkles in buried pipes.
In the second phase, finite element (FE) models were developed and calibrated by the results of full-scale pipe buckling tests and then used to obtain the patterns (or
signatures) of the strain distributions along pipes under combined loading. Based on the results of the parametric study, a SHM system is proposed. The system integrated the distributed strain sensing system (such as Brillouin scattering fiber-optic sensory system), numerical models (FE models), and damage detection models (artificial neural network (ANN)) into a reliable, real-time monitoring
system. Thereby, a methodology of health monitoring of the buried pipe buckling was carried out.
The last phase of the research focuses on the development of the damage detection models (DDM) in the SHM system. The effects of different parameters on the strain distribution patterns were studied by using a total of 74 FE models.
The framework of the damage detection models was achieved mainly by four trained ANN protocols. The proposed damage detection model provides an accuracy of 90% in evaluating the health of the buried pipes during buckling and can reliably detect the onset of pipe wrinkling before the maximum strains accumulated on the monitored pipe reach 65% of the critical strain.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: To meet increasing power needs of industrialized and urbanized consumers, power transmission companies are pressed to elevate the transmitted load in overhead power transmission lines. Increased loads impose thermal and mechanical stress, causing risks of transmission reliability. These risks can be mitigated by developing computational diagnostic tools for better scheduling of line inspections and maintenance.
The thesis introduces a novel methodology for spatial analysis of conductor thermal aging based on historical weather data that can be performed at three different levels: point, line, and area. By utilizing this paradigm, the thermal state of an energized transmission
line can be visualized, initiating a new dimension in thermal aging research.
An advanced model for dynamic re-rating of existing transmission lines is introduced in the thesis to reduce the risk of sag. The performance of the thermal aging and re-rating models is examined using simulation data from the BC Hydro power transmission network.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cayman Brac (19 km long, 1.5 to 3 km wide), which is the easternmost of the Cayman Islands, is characterized by a thick Tertiary carbonate succession that has been pervasively dolomitized.  The finely crystalline dolostones in the Cayman Formation (Miocene) are fabric-retentive whereas the coarse, sucrosic dolostones in the Brac Formation (Lower Oligocene) are mostly fabric-destructive.
Analyses of these dolostones indicate that (1) the dolostones are formed of various mixtures of low-Ca calcian dolomite (LCD – &lt; 55 mol% CaCO3) and high-Ca Calcian dolomite (HCD – &gt; 55 mol% CaCO3), (2) their geochemical signatures (e.g., δ18O and Sr) are heavily influenced by the dolomite stoichiometry, (3) the 87Sr/86Sr ratios point to two phases of dolomitization with Phase I (Late Miocene, 6-8 Ma) that caused partial dolomitization of the upper part of the Brac Formation and basal part of the Cayman Formation and Phase II (Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, 1-5 Ma), that completed dolomitization of the Cayman Formation.  Interpretation of these data indicates that dolomitization was probably linked to sea level fluctuations whereas the distribution of the dolomite and evolution of their textures was controlled largely by permeability pathways that governed circulation patterns of the dolomitizing fluids.  The large sucrosic dolomite crystals in the Brac Formation probably developed as a result of repeated cycles of limestone matrix dissolution and dolomite precipitation.  
Rare earth elements (REE) and yttrium (Y) concentrations of carbonates from Cayman Brac are characterized by (1) LREE depletion relative to HREE, (2) positive La anomalies, (3) negative Ce anomalies, and (4) superchondritic Y/Ho molar ratios.  Dolomitization did not have a major impact on their REE +Y signatures, which indicates that the dolomitization was probably mediated by seawater-like fluids.  The variations in DyN/SmN, LaN/NdN, Ce/Ce*, and Y/Ho with depth reflect the influences of the diagenetic processes (e.g., DyN/SmN ) and possibly, secular changes in the REE+Y composition of seawater (e.g., LaN/NdN, Y/Ho, and Sm/Nd) on the REE+Y signature of carbonates.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: I investigated the population and landscape genetics of Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) distributed throughout several connected river systems in Alberta, Canada. Broad- and fine-scale population structure was examined by genotyping nine microsatellite loci in 1,116 Arctic Grayling captured from 40 sites in the Hay River, Peace River, and Athabasca River basins. Genetic diversity tended to decline from north to south (allele richness-latitude: Spearman’s rank correlation rs = 0.793, P &lt; 0.05), with the lowest level detected in a stocked population. Significant genetic divergence between and within major river basins was found (overall FST (θ) = 0.13) as well as strong isolation by distance patterns in the Peace River basin (Mantel r = 0.97, P &lt; 0.001) and Athabasca River basin (Mantel r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.001). Evidence for gene flow among sites in neighbouring rivers (i.e., 25–100 km apart) was common; significant genetic differentiation tended to occur at the sub-basin level. Allelic richness (Ar) was associated with variables describing post-glacial colonization route, spatial position in the stream network, and density of anthropogenic disturbance. These findings have important implications for species management and conservation, particularly in regards to management unit delineation, supplementation procedures, conservation priorities (i.e., protecting small and/or isolated stocks), and land-use planning.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Separation of low molecular weight ions and hydrophilic analytes is achieved by high performance ion chromatography (IC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The goal of this thesis was three-fold: to increase the efficiency of IC separations by employing small particles; to develop new selectivity phases for HILIC; and to understand the factors that can lead to distorted peak shapes.
Long columns packed with large polymeric particles (6.5-13 µm) still dominate IC. This work investigated 3 µm carbon clad zirconia to which benzene sulfonic acid was bonded using diazonium chemistry. A 5 cm agglomerated anion exchanger was developed by adsorbing polycationic latexes to the particle surface. The efficiencies achieved (~ 51,000 /m) were superior to those of commercial column (~ 22,500 /m).
In addition to particle size, column packing process strongly affects the efficiency. Packing studies with sulfonated particles (4.4 µm) showed that dispersed slurries are desirable to avoid particle agglomeration. Dispersed suspensions exhibit shear thickening that can be overcome by heating the slurry during column packing. Near optimum (reduced plate height ~ 2) packing of agglomerated columns was achieved. These studies concluded that the colloidal and rheological aspects of microparticulates must be considered to optimize packing.
A new class of HILIC phases was created by modification of porous graphitic carbon (PGC) using diazonium chemistry. The hydrophobic PGC surface was converted into a polar HILIC phase by attaching benzoic acid groups. This phase showed unusual selectivity, which was different from 35 stationary phases. The utility of the phase was demonstrated for separations of nucleotides, phenols, and carboxylic acids.
Overloading a column reduces the separation efficiency and alters the peak shape from Gaussian peaks to fronted or tailed peak profiles. Studies with IC columns showed that if the eluent anion is more strongly retained than the analyte ion on an ion exchanger, the analyte peak is fronting. If the eluent is more weakly retained on the stationary phase, the analyte peak always tails under overload conditions.
Overall, this work has enhanced the fundamental understanding in the column packing process and offered new materials for the separation of ionic and polar analytes.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, polygenic disease and is influenced by genetic, environmental and life-style factors. Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer risk have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) by several research groups for different populations. However, the variants identified so far contribute to a small proportion of disease risk. The objectives of the work described in this thesis were (i) to seek relevance/replicability of reported risk alleles from SNP scans to our study population; and (ii) to perform an independent GWAS for identification of additional/novel polymorphisms in the Albertan population. We approached these two end points by using cases and controls recruited in Alberta (total sample size, n=3064) in a two-stage association study (discovery study followed by replication study). We reproduced 14 of the 28 variants reported by others and also identified seven novel variants associated with breast cancer risk in our study population.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The demand for a new solvent to treat oilsands was behind the purpose of this project; molecular dynamics simulation was used in this study. Supercritical water, supercritical carbon dioxide and other selected organic solvents in their supercritical state were studied. Meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (H2TPP) and Octaethyl porphyrin (H2OEP) are the porphyrin model compounds and, 4’-Bis-(2-pyren-1-yl-ethyl)-[2, 2’] bipyridinyl (PBP) is the asphaltene model compound. A solubility parameter approach was used to infer the solubility of model compounds in the supercritical fluids. First, the solubility of water, carbon dioxide, 4 selected organic solvents, and the three model compounds were computed using molecular dynamics simulation and compared with experimental results. The computed solubility parameters showed that the model compounds would dissolve in supercritical water (22.5 MPa and 645-655 K) but exhibited no solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In the past two decades, the idea of Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) devices has received a growing attention from researchers. A Lab-on-a-Chip device can be thought of as a miniaturized biological microchip that integrates several functionalities such as sample pre-treatment, sample transportation, mixing, reaction, separation and detection. Among the important functionalities that have been successfully integrated into a Lab-on-a-Chip device is the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process which enables rapid and inexpensive genetic analysis. PCR process relies on a thermal cycling process of repeated heating and cooling to replicate the DNA to a sufficient amount for detection and analysis. However, the PCR process requires precise measurement and control of the reaction temperature that is a challenging problem especially in the miniaturized LOC environment. The challenges associated with the thermal control problem of a PCR process in the LOC environment fall into two categories: first, there is no direct measurement of the temperature inside the reaction chamber and second, the heat distribution equation governing the thermal dynamics inside the microchip naturally leads the modeling and control of the microchip into the distributed parameter systems framework.

This thesis deals with the estimation of the temperature inside the PCR-LOC microchip. Our goal in this thesis has two folds: first to contribute to the backstepping theory for the PDE systems both in the observer design and controller design stages, and second to use this theory for our application, PCR-LOC microchip. 

PDE Backstepping boundary observer design and its successful implementation involve several challenges, including:

-Solving the PDE equation for the kernel function of the integral transformation in the PDE backstepping design and all of the numerical issues that come along.
-Simulation aspects of the coupled PDE system composed of the PDE observer and the original PDE system.
-Verification aspects, i.e. how to ensure that calibration is correct and the PDE observer actually presents the temperature inside the chamber.

This thesis presents a number of innovative approaches to exclusively deal with each of the aforementioned challenges. The successful implementation of the designed observer and a previously designed controller is also presented.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Anaerobic codigestion of municipal wastewater sludge and restaurant grease was investigated in a semi-continuous lab-scale digestion experiment under mesophilic conditions (37 °C).  Compared to the control digester, chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate for test digester was elevated to 387% (organic loading rate 4.235 kgVS/m3/d) and led to 467%  increase in daily biogas production, 25.2% increase in methane yield (based on VS deduction), 29.8% increase in COD reduction rate and 27.2% increase in VS reduction rate, respectively. Methane content ranged from 62% to 67%. There was no negative effect of grease addition on the digester performance in this experiment. The great increases in biogas production and methane yield indicated enhanced digestion performance. In addition, partial alkalinity and pH proved to be good indicators to monitor digestion process and predict overloading.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Abstract

The purpose of this research was to explore, through interviews, miscue and retrospective miscue analysis, and retellings of stories, the oral reading performance of three English as a second language (ESL) students and their perceptions of the reading process, their knowledge of the English language cueing systems and their use of strategies in reading narrative and expository passages in English. The Burke Modified Reading Interview was administered to explore the students’ perceptions of the reading process and of themselves as readers. Additional interviews were conducted to obtain information about their schooling and literacy background. The students’ miscues while reading narrative and expository passage from an informal reading inventory were recorded, transcribed and coded using selected parts of Goodman’s reading miscue inventory. Students listened to their miscues during retrospective miscue analysis sessions and engaged in self-reflection and exploratory talk to discuss why they made those miscues. The findings showed that the students’ perceptions of reading varied. The print-based readers relied heavily on graphophonic strategies and knowledge-based readers focused on semantic strategies in reading the selected passages. All of the participants read below their grade levels. The findings also revealed that these students created images and overarching schemata in their imaginations as they were reading the selected texts. The students performed better on passages about which they had strong background knowledge. Their relative performance with narrative and expository structures varied. It was concluded that ESL students need more instruction and experience in reading informational texts and need to learn new strategies for making inferences from the texts using their knowledge of the language cueing systems and their knowledge of the world.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study identified and characterized how health inspectors practiced health promotion. A literature-derived policy framework, the social determinants of health, and Ottawa Charter (WHO, 1986) were used in a mixed-method research design of interview, survey, and document analysis. Fifteen health inspectors were interviewed, 51 surveyed and four key policy documents were analyzed. Content and statistical analysis revealed that health inspectors practiced health promotion opportunistically and unintentionally, creating an incremental, inconsistent approach when enforcement of public health policy (health protection) did not resolve individual client needs. The evidence supported the assertion that without clear policy and leadership health promotion practice was inconsistent and uncoordinated.  Research following on from the study’s findings should be focused on identified facilitators and barriers of public health policy implementation building organizational capacity for health promotion practice. This study demonstrated that health protection and health promotion can work together to maintain and enhance the health of Albertans.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research challenges the notion of evaluation as being necessarily reductive, judgmental and often leading to ill-fated results by using creative methods to evaluate a nonprofit arts-based children's program. Using photography as an ethnographic approach to form the basis of in-depth interviews and by collaboratively creating an artwork from participants' photos, the results of the research reveals that evaluation can be an elightening and rewarding experience for stakeholders and evaluators alike. In addition, this research provided a nonprofit arts-based children's program with a useful, comprehensive evaluation and it encourages further exploration into creative evaluative techniques.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objectives of this thesis were to investigate some physiological, cellular and molecular changes from genetic selection, flock age and egg storage on embryonic metabolism, cell viability and gene expression in poultry species. Embryonic heat production (EHP), the parameter used to evaluate metabolic status of two turkey genetic strains (Nicholas and Hybrid) and four flock ages (30 wk, 34 wk, 55 wk, 60 wk) were determined. The results showed that embryos of older flocks had higher EHP than all other flock ages. The higher metabolism can cause overheating in embryos from older flocks during the later part of incubation. The EHP values can assist incubator manufacturers and hatchery managers to manage incubation temperatures to increase embryo survival. The EHP was also determined in two Ross 308 broiler breeder egg storage durations (4 d and 14 d) to assess the impact of long-term egg storage on embryonic metabolism. The embryos from 4 d stored eggs had higher body weight and EHP than embryos from 14 d stored eggs. To investigate what could be the fundamental reasons for the metabolic differences, blastoderms from eggs in these egg storage treatments were isolated, dissociated into single cells, stained with fluorescent dyes and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to differentiate between viable (live), apoptotic and necrotic cell populations. Quantitative real time PCR analysis was then used to compare the expression of selected apoptotic genes (Bak, Bax, Bok, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) in blastoderms and embryos from 6 d incubated eggs. While percentage of viable cells decreased significantly, an unregulated amount of apoptosis increased with egg storage duration (p &lt; 0.0001). Expression of pro-apoptotic genes (Bak, Bax, and Bok) were up regulated as storage duration increased at the blastodermal level but all genes were down regulated after 6 d of incubation. This suggests that an increment in egg storage duration can cause activation of apoptotic cell death mechanisms at the blastodermal level, which can be one of the molecular mechanisms that led to the reduced daily embryonic growth and metabolism observed in 14 d stored eggs. The thesis suggests there are molecular and cellular implications of egg storage.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Little is known about the effect disturbances such as pipelines can have on prairie plant species at risk and their critical habitat in Alberta. Halimolobos virgata appears to be a ruderal, disturbance evolved species that occupies a unique rim niche. This habitat around the rim of depressional areas is slightly compacted with high bare ground, low litter, lower surrounding vegetation height and slightly different soil chemical properties compared to random, typical prairie environments. A pipeline changes the environment up to 25 m from the pipeline right of way edge with increases in soil compaction, bare ground and non native plant species richness and decreases in litter cover. This distance is recommended as a set back for Cryptantha minima. Halimolobos virgata can recolonize a pipeline right of way under certain pipeline construction conditions, thus a set back distance is not required provided construction is under these specified conditions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examined the efficacy of residual forest structure for the preservation and recovery of bryophytes five to six years after partial canopy harvest in boreal mixed-wood forests of northwestern Alberta, Canada. Bryophytes were sampled in two forest types that differed in pre-harvest abundance of broadleaf (primarily Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. balsamifera L.) and coniferous (primarily Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) canopy trees. In Chapter 2, epiphytic bryophytes growing on aspen (P. tremuloides) were characterized by species viability and nearest-neighbour relationships. Epiphyte assemblage structure showed increasing impact with declining retention owing to degradation of growing conditions for species on trees. Chapter 3 provided an analysis of species richness and abundance patterns in relation to residual canopy structure. Bryophytes generally benefitted from higher canopy retention; however, epixylic and epiphytic species were more sensitive to partial harvesting than species on other substrates, and liverworts were more sensitive than mosses. Liverworts exhibited higher among-site differences in richness as retention declined, which partly resulted from increasing numbers of local species extinctions. In an analysis of species-environment relations in partially-harvested forests in Chapter 4, forest moisture was reduced with any degree of harvesting in both forest types. Lower canopy retention and forest moisture levels were associated with reduced abundances of species with particular biological traits, such as limited reproduction and dispersal capacities. Their re-establishment after harvesting may be impeded because of biological and environmental limitations. Coniferous-dominated forests supported higher abundances of liverworts and species with greater moisture requirements than did mixed-wood broadleaf-coniferous forests, and are potentially important refuges of bryophyte source populations. Chapter 5 examined the capacity for bryophyte species to germinate from diaspore banks in forest soils. Species germinated readily from mineral soil samples obtained from harvested sites, including several perennials characteristic of intact forests. Diaspore banks may serve as a persistent source for species colonization at post-disturbance sites, but only under appropriate growing conditions and not for species that were most sensitive to harvesting. Overall, both amount and composition of forest structure retained after partial harvesting are important management considerations for ensuring conservation of the wide variety of bryophyte species in mixed-wood landscapes.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Propositional satisability (SAT) has been a dominant tool in solving some practical NP-complete problems. However, SAT also has a number of weaknesses, including its inability to compactly represent numerical constraints and its low level, unstructured language of clauses. In contrast, Constraint Programming (CP) has been widely used for scheduling and solving combinatorial search problems. In this thesis, we develop a tight integration of SAT with CP, called SAT(gc), which embeds global constraints, one of the most efficient features of CP, into SAT. We devise a DPLL-based algorithm for a SAT(gc) solver. A prototype system is implemented by integrating the state of the art SAT solver Zchaff and the generic constraint solver named Gecode. Experiments are carried out for benchmarks from puzzle domains and planning domains to reveal insights in compact representation, solving effectiveness, and novel usabilities of the new framework.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A comprehensive investigation of cycloalkenyl-alkyne coupling reactions mediated by cobalt(III) templates is presented.  The in situ derived cationic η3-cyclohexenyl complexes of cobalt(III) react with some terminal alkynes to afford either η1,η4-bicyclo[4.3.1]decadienyl or η2,η3-vinylcyclohexenyl products, depending on the type and concentration of the alkyne.  The mechanism for this cyclohexenyl-alkyne cycloaddition reaction is consistent with the previously reported cobalt-mediated [3 + 2 + 2] allyl-alkyne coupling reaction. 
	The carbon-carbon bond activation/cyclopentenyl-alkyne ring expansion process was also studied using the 1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl cobalt system.  A modified synthetic strategy to the requisite half-sandwich cobalt(I) cyclopentadiene precursor was developed using cobalt(II) acetoacetonate, avoiding the use of simple cobalt(II) halides which are prone to ligand disproportionation.  Furthermore, the preparation of the cobalt(III) cyclopentenyl precursor, (t-Bu2C5H3)Co(η4-C5H6), was accomplished via hydride addition to the easily prepared cobalticenium complex [(t-Bu2C5H3)Co(C5H5)]BF4 and avoids the use of the thermally sensitive (t-Bu2C5H3)Co(ethylene)2. 
	Disubstituted alkynes such as 2-butyne or diphenylacetylene undergo cyclopentenyl coupling to afford the corresponding η5-cycloheptadienyl products, albeit in lower yields compared to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl cobalt system.  The 1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl ancillary ligand shows unique and unusual reactivity, coupling with tert-butylacetylene to afford a novel spiro[4.5]decatrienyl complex.  Ultimately, the poor isolated yields of seven-membered products demonstrate that the disubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand system is a poor candidate for future studies in this area.
	A mechanistic investigation of the cobalt-mediated carbon-carbon bond activation process was performed.  Cationic cobalt η2-vinyl complexes were proposed as viable intermediates in the activation process and synthetic routes to these compounds were examined.  However, the resulting vinyl complexes were unstable and could not be directly isolated and characterized.  Preparation of cobalt vinyl complexes in the presence of cycloalkadienes did not furnish the expected cycloexpanded products, suggesting alternative routes to the cobalt vinyl intermediates are necessary.  During the course of the mechanistic investigation, a high-yielding alternative synthetic procedure for (C5Me5)Co(η4-butadiene) from the easily prepared precursor, [(C5Me5)CoI2]n, was found,  circumventing the use of the thermally sensitive (C5Me5)Co(ethylene)2.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: We consider the scheduling problem in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with successive zero-forcing precoding and coordinated transmit-receive processing. Focusing specifically on the problem of user and data stream scheduling, we allow variable number of data streams per user. Optimal scheduling employing exhaustive search for a constant number of streams per user is already combinatorially complex, and is further compounded by allowing for a variable number of streams per user. We consider a suboptimal metaheuristic scheduling algorithm based on simulated annealing, an algorithm which has shown to provide quick and relatively good solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. We introduce various parameters and examine their impact on the performance of the algorithm. Simulated annealing is shown to offer comparable results at a fraction of the computational cost of the exhaustive search. Our contributions to this area are emphasized in the conclusion and future areas of work are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Despite extensive knowledge of variations in motoneuron (MN) soma and muscle properties across different healthy muscles or motor units, there is comparatively little knowledge about variations in motor axon electrophysiology across different axon groups.  Axon excitability testing (AET) is an in vivo method which indirectly examines motor axon electrophysiology.  We used AET in Sprague-Dawley rats to compare axons innervating tibialis anterior (“fast” motor axons) to axons innervating soleus (“slow” motor axons).  We found that fast and slow motor axons differ significantly in their accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents, and  in their post-spike excitability oscillation.  Specifically, we found compelling evidence that slow motor axons have greater activity of the hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying cation conductance (IH) than fast motor axons.  Since fast and slow motor axons have different daily activity patterns, this foreshadows the possibility of activity-dependent plasticity in at least one ionic conductance of the motor axon.</etd_ms:description>

consecutively within the same egg cytoplasm. The order of events during
this transition is controlled, in part, via the regulation of the microtubule
cytoskeleton. Herein, I show that mel-43 is part of a small paralogous
gene family that is required to specify the meiosis II program of cell
division in the fertilized egg. RNAi of mel-43 and paralogues resulted in
failed meiosis I polar body extrusion, followed by direct entry into mitotic
prophase. Furthermore, the dominant maternal-effect mutation mel-
43(sb41) showed a meiosis-to-mitosis transition delay and a failure to
segregate chromatids that exhibited persistent REC-8/kleisin
immunostaining. Anti-MEL-43 antibodies showed that the MEL-43
proteins exhibited high cytoplasmic levels in meiosis as well as a fibrous
staining pattern in the midzone of the anaphase spindle. The protein
levels were reduced after meiosis, and this was dependent on the CUL-
2/ZYG-11 E3 ligase complex.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In oil sands mining operations, water-based mixtures containing coarse sand grains and fine mineral solids (including clays) are ubiquitous. The clay fraction can have a detrimental effect on the separation of bitumen from the oil sand matrix, on the hydrotransport pipelines, and on water recycle. As such, the particle size and concentration of the colloidal clay particles and the rheology of aqueous suspension of these particles must be monitored.
The Particle Size Distribution (PSD), along with pH and ion concentration in the continuous phase, govern particle-particle and particle-continuous phase interactions. These interactions in turn dictate the overall behavior of mixtures containing clays. Therefore, any factor that can bias or alter the clay PSD of the mineral solids must be investigated. For example these mixtures are typically exposed to sonication before particle size analyses are conducted. In this study, the effect of sonication on the kaolinite clay PSD - as an analog of the clays found in the oil sands - was examined. The size measurements were carried out using a Flow Particle Image Analyzer (Sysmex FPIA-3000). This study demonstrates that sonication results in a reduction of the number of large particles and also an increase in the proportion of the smallest particles. Results of experiments conducted on slurries having different pH, electrolyte concentrations and solids concentrations showed that these factors, along with sonication time and power, have a significant effect on the extent of the particle size reduction.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) has been extensively used in educational research with large sample sizes and normally distributed traits. However, there are cases in which distributions are not normal, and research has shown that the estimation of parameters becomes problematic with non-normal data. This study investigates the effects of skewness on parameter estimation using the Graded Response Model (GRM) and MULTILOG. Three distribution types (extreme and moderate skewness and a baseline condition (i.e. normal) and seven sample sizes (from n = 100 to n = 3,000) were investigated using simulations. In keeping with previous findings, the extremely skewed distribution condition resulted in the poorest estimates regardless of sample size. In general, the accuracy of parameter estimation increased as sample size increased. For the normally distributed conditions, results suggest a minimum sample size of 750 for accurate estimation. Implications of these findings are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Mineral carbon sequestration (MCS) is a type of carbon storage based on natural rock weathering processes where CO2, dissolved in rainwater, reacts with alkaline minerals to form solid carbonates. Although MCS has advantages over other carbon storage techniques, an economic MCS process has not yet been developed. Two approaches were taken in this work to reduce the cost of MCS. The first approach was to use a waste material, serpentine waste from ultramafic nickel ore processing, as a feedstock. The second approach was to use pre-treatments to increase the carbon storage capacity of the waste material. Two pre-treatments were developed in this work. The first pre-treatment, microwave pre-treatment, was identified as a way not only to improve the carbon sequestration capacity of the waste, but also to improve the mineral processing of ultramafic nickel ores. Microwave pre-treatment was shown to successfully convert serpentine in ultramafic nickel ores to olivine, to improve the grindability of ultramafic nickel ores with consistent texture, to reduce the viscosity of ultramafic nickel ore slurries by an average of 80%, and to enhance the CO2 storage capacity of ultramafic nickel ores by a factor of up to 5. The second pre-treatment developed was leaching with ligands at neutral to alkaline pH. Catechol, EDTA and tiron were shown to greatly improve the leaching rate and total magnesium leached from ultramafic nickel ores. While EDTA proved to be too strong of a ligand to allow the precipitation of MgCO3 from solution, catechol and tiron promoted the formation of MgCO3, particularly at pH 10. Overall, tiron was the most effective ligand for enhancing MCS and increased the CO2 storage capacity of ultramafic nickel ores by a factor of up to 3. Although the pre-treatment techniques developed required optimization, both microwave pre-treatment and leaching with ligands at neutral to alkaline pH show promise for ultimately reducing the cost of MCS.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: If all cells in a multicellular organism contain exactly the same genetic information, the question arises of how tissue types with distinct gene expression profiles are formed and maintained over the life of the organism. These different temporal and spatial gene expression patterns are thought to be built by activating and repressing proteins and RNAs to create self-perpetuating chromatin states. Identifying these components is the first and fundamental step in understanding this type of control of gene expression, and is the focus of this thesis. My model system centers on P{lacW}ciDplac , a white (w+) transgene insert on chromosome 4 of
Drosophila melanogaster. P{lacW}ciDplac is a previously characterized enhancer trap of ciD that should be sensitive to many of the proteins that regulate ci during development. Normally, the white gene within P{lacW}ciDplac is expressed throughout the adult eye and presents a
uniform red eye phenotype. However, the presence of other P elements results in stochastic silencing of the w+ of this transgene and a variegated phenotype in a process called P element dependent silencing (PDS). A derivative allele of P{lacW}ciDplac was isolated, called E1, that contained a distal gypsy element insertion. This allele variegates in the absence of
other P elements, and the variegating phenotype can be suppressed by and enhanced by modifiers of wm4 in a manner similar to heterochromatic Position Effect Variegation (hPEV). I performed a genetic screen formodifiers of E1 variegation and isolated mutations that fell into complementation groups on both the second and third chromosomes. I identified 5 of these groups as: TAF4, a general transcription factor; cg, an already characterized regulator of ci; ash1 and trx, known regulators of homeotic genes not previously shown to act at ci; and CG8878, a putative protein kinase of unknown specificity. I also isolated a complementation group that was too weak in phenotype to accurately map via
recombination and several singles, which were not pursued farther. I chose to investigate the alleles of ash1, trx, and CG8878. This thesis describes their generation, isolation and further characterization.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis will engage with a multitude of critical theories, sociological studies, and political legislation in an attempt to demonstrate the role female-centered literature is playing in the cultural revision of the Irish nation at the turn of the twenty-first century. In an effort to interrogate the state of social change, I will draw on contemporary feminist novels and short stories in order to answer a question lingering behind the so-called “success” of Irish modernity: How did we get here? Literature is the very site in which Irish identity is being deconstructed, renegotiated, and rewritten, and the retrospective struggles of Irish women are the narratives through which authors are choosing to investigate the past and question the ideological forces of social transformation. However, this is not an all-encompassing study, merely a snapshot of some of the themes, questions, and concerns occupying the minds of Irish writers throughout the Celtic Tiger.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The first chapter of this thesis describes methodology on an all-carbon intramolecular conjugate displacement between a carbon nucleophile and a Morita-Baylis-Hillman adduct for making carbocyclic skeletons. The reaction scope was examined with different electron-withdrawing groups, types of carbon nucleophile and leaving groups. The study demonstrated that this transformation is a convenient and effective way of constructing carbocycles, including some synthetically challenging structures. The mechanism of this transformation was probed by experiments designed to trap a possible anionic species of a non-concerted pathway. The second part of my thesis describes studies towards the total synthesis of the natural product MPC1001, which is a potential anti-tumor agent. Effort was focused on inventing a way of installing a disulfur bridge in a stereo-controlled manner. Difficulties were encountered for thiol deprotection, as attempted removal of many known thiol-protecting groups gave either no reaction or loss of the sulfur, possibly expelled by the nitrogen on the same carbon. Therefore, a new protecting group for thiols was designed, which could be deprotected under mild conditions. Although this protecting group allowed smooth deprotection with one specific reagent, additional problems prohibited carrying the research further using this group. A new route for installing the disulfide bridge was conceived and is still under examination.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In March 1954, the United States Air Force decided to give a high priority to developing an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). This missile, when armed with nuclear warheads, became the central and defining weapon of the Cold War. Following the political controversy in the United States that resulted from the Soviet Union’s launch in 1957 of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite of the Earth, a number of historians strongly criticized the U.S. Air Force and the Administrations of President Harry S. Truman, who held office from 1945 to 1953, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served from 1953 to 1961, for not moving more quickly on rocket and missile programs, which they argued allowed the Soviets to gain possession of the first ICBM before the United States. This study argues that the relatively limited power of early atomic weapons and the technical challenges involved in building long-range missiles were the most important reasons the United States government did not give ICBMs a high priority before 1954, rather than air force reluctance to give up crewed aircraft, as has been previously argued. Government policymakers and scientific and engineering experts were preoccupied in the late 1940s drawing up policies for nuclear weapons and developing bomber aircraft and aircrews capable of delivering nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union, and missiles to defend against Soviet bomber aircraft. In 1954 the advent of thermonuclear or fusion weapons with their enhanced firepower and small size caused experts and policymakers to move ahead with the development of America’s first ICBM, the Atlas. Instead of working back from the political controversy that followed the 1957 launch of Sputnik, as influential historical accounts of this period have done, this dissertation places the actions of Truman and Eisenhower Administration policymakers into the broad context of the technical, scientific, political and economic environment that existed from 1945 to 1954. In doing so, this study seeks to show how technological, political and social forces combined to lead to the creation of a new technological system, the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile armed with nuclear weapons, which became a key part of America’s nuclear forces.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Eggs are an economical source of nutrient rich food containing essential nutrients but are also one of the eight most common foods causing allergy today. Eggs are present in a wide variety of foods including sauces, bread and pasta. A novel method for the production of hypoallergenic egg ingredients should be developed. Fermentation of egg white proteins in sourdough was studied and revealed that ovotransferrin was degraded. No significant change was noted in ELISA while immunoblot showed elimination of IgE binding to the single protein ovotransferrin.
	Fermentation of egg white solutions and extracted ovomucoid was also studied and revealed that A. oryzae fermented samples showed a decrease in IgE binding with a minor shift in ovalbumin-related protein Y, characterized by LC ESI-MS and MS/MS. The use of fermentation as a pretreatment in ovomucoids’ susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis showed that there was no significant difference before and after fermentation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research is aimed at understanding near-neutral pH SCC initiation under disbonded coatings of pipeline steels, and the effect of different environmental and operational factors on crack initiation.  Understanding near-neutral pH stress corrosion cracking (SCC) could answer many of the primary questions on crack initiation of SCC which have not yet been answered.  It could also assist the development of effective mitigative measures dealing with thousands of kilometer of pipelines containing this form of cracking, in addition to preventive action for future pipeline installations.  

Near-neutral pH SCC usually occurs under polyethylene tape (PE tape) coated pipelines, at locations where the coating becomes disbonded and/or damaged.  Ground water can then penetrate under the damaged/disbonded coating, become trapped and form a suitable environment for corrosion and cracking.  Despite extensive studies on this topic the details of crack initiation mechanisms in addition to the exact role of environmental and operational factors on crack initiation are not thoroughly understood.  Most previous laboratory tests have been done in aggressive loading conditions and ignored the effect of coatings and cathodic protections (CP). 

In order to simulate the conditions responsible for crack initiation, a novel testing setup capable of simulating the synergistic effects of coating disbondment, cathodic protection and cyclic loading was implemented.  Using this setup and long term laboratory tests near-neutral pH SCC initiation mechanisms and the effect of some environmental and operational factors on crack initiation were investigated.  It was found that near-neutral pH SCC initiation does not necessarily occur in near-neutral pH environments as commonly believed.  Depending on the level of CP and CO2 in the underground environment, different localized environments with varying pH values from near-neutral to high values above 10 can form under the disbonded coatings.  This significantly affected the corrosion and near-neutral pH SCC initiation mechanisms.  These investigations brought out new findings about the effect of environment and operations on near-neutral pH SCC initiation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examines patterns in bryophyte species richness and composition on the forest floor and in the soil diaspore bank of temperate rainforest stands which varied in time post-harvest. Quantitative data (abundance) was assessed in quadrats (25x25cm) on soil, decaying logs, and tree bases within sites (20x30m). Non-quantitative data (occurrence) was assessed throughout sites. Analyses of variance and ordination analyses were used to examine species richness and composition, respectively.
Above-ground, richness varied significantly with substrate but not stand age. Soils were the most speciose substrates, due to heterogeneity in young stands; logs had higher richness in older stands. Canopy cover significantly affected species composition, with a trend in dominant life strategy from colonists to perennials with canopy closure. Below-ground, richness varied significantly with depth but not with stand age. Diaspore bank richness and composition differed from the above-ground flora; colonists dominated the diaspore bank and perennials thrived above-ground.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Web, being the most popular component of the Internet, has been transformed from a static information-serving medium into a fully interactive platform. This platform has been used by developers to create web applications rivaling traditional desktop systems. Designing, developing and evaluating these applications require new or modified methodologies, techniques and tools because of the different characteristics they exhibit.  This dissertation discusses two important areas for developing and evaluating these applications: security and data mining.

In the security area, a survey using a process similar to the Goal Question Metric approach examines the properties of web application vulnerabilities. Using results from the survey, a white-box approach to identify web applications’ vulnerabilities is proposed. Although the approach eliminates vulnerabilities during the development process, it does not protect existing web applications that have not utilized the approach. Hence, an Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection System, called AIWAS, is introduced.  AIWAS protects web applications through the analysis of interactions between the users and the web applications. These interactions are classified as either benign or malicious; malicious interactions are prevented from reaching the web applications under protection. 

In the data mining area, the method of reliability estimation from server logs is examined in detail.  This examination reveals the fact that the session workload is currently obtained using a constant Session Timeout Threshold (STT) value.  However, each website is unique and should have its own STT value. Hence, an initial model for estimating the STT is introduced to encourage future research on sessions to use a customized STT value per website.  This research on the STT leads to a deeper investigation of the actual session workload unit.  More specifically, the distributional properties of the session workload are re-examined to determine whether the session workload can be described as a heavy-tailed distribution.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: It is difficult to join high strength alloy steel which are produced by thermo mechanical controlled processing and get overmatched properties on the welds and heat affected zone (HAZ) when submerged arc welding (SAW) is used as joining process. Circumferential welds made in the mill to join shorter pipes into longer lengths generally employ SAW as this process offers excellent production rate. In this study two types of X80 steel plates (both 10.22 mm thick) with different carbon contents (0.06 wt% C versus 0.03 wt% C) were used. SAW was used to join the steel plates using varying heat inputs (from 1.5 to 2.25 kJ/mm) by varying the current. Charpy V-notch (CVN) results indicate that the higher carbon steel welds have better HAZ toughness than those with the lower carbon steel at all test temperatures (from 22 to -60ºC). At higher temperatures the mode of fracture was found to be ductile in nature, whereas at lower temperatures (close to -40ºC) both ductile and brittle behaviour were observed. Hardness results indicate that there is initial softening in the fine grain heat affected zone (FGHAZ) regions and hardening occurs predominantly in the coarse grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ) regions. Also, both steels demonstrate comparable results in that hardness in the HAZ decreases as the heat input increases. The transverse weld tensile specimens gave a good indication of ultimate strength; however, the degree of overmatching could not be resolved using transverse weld tensile testing, because of the limitation in measuring tensile properties of smaller individual regions (weld metal, CGHAZ and FGHAZ).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Water is a crucial factor in the life of land plants. Transpiration (E) is inevitable and it is viewed as the universal cost of accessing a CO2-rich atmosphere. Although we now know that plants lose water at night, it had been assumed that stomata remained closed after dark. Renewed interest has encouraged more research on night-time E. An overlooked challenge in this area is that of measuring water loss. Most of the current research relies on leaf-level measurements using gas analysers. This presents many complications and although the instruments are simple to operate, it is not a trivial task to measure E properly, especially at night. I present a system that includes instructions to build the hardware platform and the software package, which utilises balances to measure E simultaneously and continuously from multiple specimens. The system is particularly suited to measuring nocturnal E of whole plants since it requires minimal interaction and it is not intrusive for the plant. With this system, a survey of whole-plant nocturnal E was carried out on four species of Populus with a range of habitat preference from riparian to upland. This survey characterises night-time water loss in relation to habitat, showing that Populus from drier environments may curtail night-time E more readily than riparian species. The survey also investigates the effect of drought on nocturnal E, arguing that night-time sap flow may be associated with one or more physiological functions. Lastly, the effect of two forms of N (NO3- and NH4+) on whole-plant conductance is analysed in two hybrid poplars with different growth potentials. NH4+ is shown to depress day-time, but not night-time conductance in comparison with NO3-; likely due to a change in stomatal function. Root anatomy was radically changed in a species-dependent manner when grown under different N forms. Some of these changes reflect different metabolic needs associated with each N form, while others may have a direct bearing on plant hydraulics.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a grade IV brain tumour. It is the most common brain malignancy and is extremely aggressive. Ionizing radiation plays a vital role in the treatment of this tumour. Growth of the GBM is sustained by a subpopulation of the tumour cells often called the glioma stem cells (GSC). Kim et al. and Gao et al. presented in vitro and in silico data respectively where GSC population seemed unnaturally increased. We created four nested ODE models for GBM growth. Parameters were estimated from the available data using the least squares error method and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to choose a suitable model for tumour growth. The aspect of irradiation treatment was incorporated into the glioma growth model using the linear-quadratic model. My analysis on the treatment ODE model supports the findings of Gao et al. that the increased stem cell ratios can only be explained if the stem cell population divides more aggressively after radiotherapy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Lochkovian (Lower Devonian) Man on the Hill (MOTH ) locality, Northwest Territories, Canada, is a Konservat-Lagerstätte, where articulated early vertebrate remains are found. Among the early vertebrates preserved at the MOTH locality are the Osteostraci.  Many specimens of osteostracan have been recovered since the last descriptions of osteostracan material from MOTH. New species of osteostracan are described here, including five new genera. The new taxa are examined in a phylogenetic analysis that includes most of the genera of the Osteostraci. The topology recovered was then used to reconstruct the ancestral biogeographic distributions of osteostracans. Of particular interest among the new taxa is a new family that includes Superciliaspis, and a primitive non-cornuate osteostracan. The new osteostracans support dispersal from Spitsbergen, Norway into MOTH with a specimen of Machairaspis, and the presence of Waengsjoeaspis at both localities, but all of the species, including six genera, are endemic to MOTH.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Since the first experimental demonstration of the negative-refractive-index metamaterial by Shelby et al. in the early 2000s, metamaterials have experienced great interest from research community, resulting in an increasingly large number of publications. Truly three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials, which are able to interact with electromagnetic sources from free space, have been targeted in much of metamaterial research. The physical implementation of such structures is often exorbitantly complicated. In some applications, which require free-space sources to be particularly polarized, 3D metamaterials can be replaced by volumetric metamaterials, which are an extension of 2D metamaterials in the third dimension, and are realized by stacking layers of 2D metamaterials. Volumetric metamaterials employ both surface-mount and fully-printed elements as reactive loads. Fully printed volumetric metamaterials are the most cost-effective because their fabrication is suitable for standard lithography processes. However, previous fully-printed structures suffered from weak reactive loads, resulting in a high operation frequency, hence, a large electrical length per unit cell. This thesis presents a bi-planar design utilizing MIM-type capacitors and dual-arm spiral inductors, which can easily be fabricated with normal printed-circuit-board technology, making it low-cost. The proposed structure operates at 4.4 GHz, resulting in a small electrical length of one eleventh of free-space wavelength. The simulated data show that the structure can be treated as an isotropic effective medium possessing effective permittivity, permeability, and refractive index close to negative unity. The metamaterial may find applications as flat lenses in microwave hyperthermia, and in the improvement of antenna performance.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Photochemical reactions resulting from the absorption of ultraviolet light are one of the main causes of DNA damage. For any excited-state photochemical reaction, it is the  structural changes in  the excited state after the absorption of the photon that ultimately decide the photochemical fate of the molecule. In this thesis, I have explored the initial excited-state structural dynamics of nucleic acid derivatives and a rhodopsin analogue to understand the structural distortions upon photon absorption and the correlation between the observed structural dynamics and the known photochemistry.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the initial excited-state structural dynamics of 5,6-dimethyluracil, to understand the effect of mass changes at the C5 and C6 positions, and found that the observed initial excited-state structural dynamics are similar to those of thymine. This study showed that the methyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions are a major factor in determining how the initial excited-state structural dynamics are partitioned between the CH bending and C5=C6 stretching modes, which is directly related to the difference in the photochemistry of uracil and thymine.

The resonance Raman-derived initial excited-state structural changes of homopentamer oligonucleotides lie along similar modes as in the corresponding nucleobases or nucleotides, but with smaller distortions. The smaller excited-state distortions suggest that the initial excited-state structural dynamics  are restricted by the polymeric structure. The observed homopentamer homogeneous broadening is consistent with this model.
 
The sequence dependence of UV-induced miRNA damage was also studied on a microarray platform. The results suggest that guanine provides a protective effect and sequences with cytosine and uracil are more susceptible to damage, although the errors are large.

The visible resonance Raman spectroscopic studies on a rhodopsin analogue show similar initial molecular distortions along the C=C bond during the isomerization as in rhodopsin. The hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) mode is absent in N-alkyalated indanylidene-Pyrroline (NAIP), as expected due to the absence of C-H modes. The computed excited-state trajectories are consistent with the experimentally observed initial distortions along the C=C bond.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated through anodization have attracted significant interest and have been widely investigated due to their great potential for many
applications related to the solar energy utilization for, e. g. photoelectrochemical water splitting, degradation of pollutants and solar cells etc. However, despite many efforts, it remains a major challenge to successful-lsyi tuin fabricate crystalline TiO2. TiO2 nanotubes made by room temperature (R. T.) are generally in the amorphous state, which need to be crystallized at elevated temperutures for the photocatalytic activity. However, during crystallization treatment at elevated temperatures, a barrier ylear forms between the nanotubular array and the substrate. The barrier layer reduces the electron transfer in photocatalytic processes such as water photoelectrolysis, which in turn reduces the overall water splitting efficiency. The oxide growth from the underlying Ti foil layer may percolate up and make the nanotubes dysfunctional. The primary objective of this thesis is to explor-es iitnu fabrication of crystalline TiO2 nanotube arrays via anodization. Anodization at different bath temperatures and anodization potentials was investigated and a direct one-step approach for in-situ fabrication of crystalline TiO2 nanotube arrays has been demonstrated.
Research was also conducted to investigate relevant issues and elucidate mechanisms involved.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research examines the stories created for Project Citizenship, a collaborative action research project between the SKILLS Society, a non-profit agency that supports people with developmental disabilities, the University of Alberta and the Nina Haggerty Center for Arts. The majority of the stories take the form of short documentary film, each representing an individual supported by SKILLS. 

Using photography, survey, participant observation, and interview, this exercise in visual anthropology and qualitative research explores what stories can do and what they can mean for various individuals, namely filmmakers, the subjects of the stories and audience members. A better understanding of how people make sense of these stories in a local context provides insight into the potential visual stories have for challenging social perceptions of disability in our communities and creating a better world inclusive of all its diverse and valued citizens.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Poor staircase architectural design could contribute to increasing the risk of falling for older adults.  This research provides an integrated evidence-based assessment of staircase architectural design to support independent living for older adults (65 years and older). The staircase assessment has been developed through dividing the staircase into four design elements: staircase geometrical design, handrail design, lighting, and step design. Each element is divided into a number of features that define its architectural design; for instance, step design is divided into four features: 1) going depth; 2) riser height; 3) nosing; and 4) steps finishing material. A rating factor is assigned to each feature representing how much it reduces the risk of falling for older adults based on previous evidence-based studies. The proposed methodology for staircase assessment has been incorporated into a mathematical model that is represented through a decision tree analysis module called “Design Assessment Tree” (DAT).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: High molecular weight polyacrylamide (PAM) was tested as a potential selective
depressant in the differential flotation separation of galena and chalcopyrite using
potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) as a collector. In single mineral flotation, PAM
depressed chalcopyrite while galena was floatable. Mechanism study indicated
that PAM could adsorb on galena through hydrogen bonding, and on chalcopyrite
through hydrogen bonding as well as ammonium-copper complexation. KEX
could only break up the galena-PAM bonding. It is the combined use of PAM and
KEX that caused the selectivity.
In mineral mixture flotation, galena and chalcopyrite could be separated by PAM
and KEX only after EDTA treatment of the mineral mixtures. Time of flight
secondary ion mass spectrometric (ToF-SIMS) measurements indicated that when
galena and chalcopyrite were present together in the suspension, PAM adsorbed
on both galena and chalcopyrite. However, after prior treatment of the mineral
mixture by EDTA, PAM mainly adsorbed on chalcopyrite.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: An important issue in translation studies is the extent to which a translator should “naturalize” a narrative - by changing proper names and cultural references, for instance - to match the background of the reader. Venuti (1986), among others, has speculated as to how readers experience texts submitted to such strategies. The present study provides an empirical examination of whether different translation strategies actually affect readers’ reaction to the plot and characters. Two versions of a translated story were compared: one in which lexical items were “foreignized,” that is, clearly marked as coming from an unfamiliar Latin American culture, and one in which those items were naturalized so that they matched the readers’ North American background. The results suggest that although readers identify the foreignized stories as more culturally distant, this awareness does not have an impact on their evaluation of the characters or plot events.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Objective: Little is known about the determinants of addictive disorders within the rapidly growing urban Aboriginal population in Canada. The objectives of this dissertation were to examine whether Aboriginal enculturation, Canadian acculturation, and racial discrimination were associated with addictive problems among urban Aboriginal Canadians, and to test potential mediators of these associations.  
Methods: Data were collected via in-person surveys and interviews with two community-based samples of Aboriginal adults living in a mid-sized city in western Canada. Sample 1 was recruited in 2008-09 and included Aboriginal university students (N = 60). Sample 2 was recruited in 2010 and included urban Aboriginal adults more generally (N = 381).   
Results: Both samples evidenced high levels of Aboriginal enculturation and Canadian acculturation. In Sample 1, Aboriginal enculturation served as a protective factor for alcohol use problems. In Sample 2, Aboriginal enculturation served as a protective factor for illicit and prescription drug problems, as well as a resilience factor that buffered the effects of low educational attainment on illicit drug problems in this population. The protective impacts of enculturation on illicit and prescription drug problems were partially explained by elevated self-esteem among urban Aboriginal participants who were more highly enculturated. Canadian acculturation was not statistically associated with alcohol or illicit drug problems and served as a risk factor for prescription drug problems among urban Aboriginal participants. Racial discrimination served as a risk factor for prescription drug problems and gambling problems. Mediational analyses indicate the impacts of racial discrimination on addictive outcomes were explained by elevated PTSD symptomology among those experiencing high levels of discrimination. These associations could not be explained by statistical adjustment for factors such as separation from birth parents in childhood, abuse in childhood, and exposure to poverty over the life course. 
Conclusions: Findings support the growth of programs and services that encourage Aboriginal peoples to maintain their culture within the urban setting. Results also support policies and programs to reduce racism directed at Aboriginal peoples in urban areas, and services to help Aboriginal peoples cope with these experiences.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Structural brain changes occur in a complex manner throughout life, and understanding healthy brain development is crucial for the study of brain abnormalities in various conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides information about tissue microstructure not accessible via conventional imaging methods.  In this dissertation, DTI is used to assess typical brain development, brain abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), and relationships between cognition and brain structure in both populations.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal DTI studies were used to measure brain maturation from childhood to adulthood. Significant, nonlinear changes of diffusion parameters were noted across the brain, with regional variation in the timing and magnitude of development. Most regions experienced rapid maturation during childhood and adolescence, reached a developmental peak during adulthood, and then, during senescence, underwent a reversal of structural changes that occurred more gradually than the initial development. The genu and splenium of the corpus callosum had the earliest development, while frontal-temporal connections and the corticospinal tracts showed the most prolonged maturation trajectories. 

DTI was also used to examine brain abnormalities in children with FASD, an acquired brain disorder associated with numerous cognitive, behavioural, and emotional difficulties. DTI revealed widespread differences in children with FASD when compared to healthy controls, suggesting extensive structural brain damage. 

Finally, significant relationships between cognitive abilities and brain structure were observed in both populations. Brain lateralization of a frontal-temporal pathway correlated with two specific cognitive abilities in typically-developing children. Additionally, a significant relationship between brain structure and mathematical ability was observed in the left parietal lobe of children with FASD. Preliminary results demonstrating reading-brain structure correlations in both healthy and FASD groups are also presented. 

In conclusion, DTI has shown significant age-related changes in the typically-developing human brain, abnormalities in children with FASD, and correlations between brain structure and cognition in both populations. Normative DTI studies such as the ones presented here are important to establish healthy milestones of brain development and degradation, which may then be used to understand abnormalities in a variety of conditions, including FASD.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Triassic lithologies in west-central Alberta are divided into the Sulphur Mountain Formation and Whitehorse Formation of the Spray River Group.  The Sulphur Mountain Formation is subdivided into three members:  the Vega-Phroso Siltstone, Whistler, and Llama members. The Whitehorse Formation is subdivided into three members: the Starlight Evaporite, Brewster Limestone, and Winnifred members. Analysis of six outcrops in the Willmore Wilderness Park for this study suggests that the Whitehorse Formation was emplaced in an overall progradational system with occasional regressive transgressive deposition.

From outcrop analysis five facies associations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) were developed based on fifteen identified facies. The five associations relate to offshore deposits (1), offshore to shoreface (2), ephemeral/lacustrine supratidal (3), aeolian sabkha depositional environments (4), and offshore turbidite deposits (5).  Ichnological, biostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic analyses of outcrop samples were used in delineating the Sulphur Mountain Formation and Whitehorse Formation of the Spray River Group.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Contraceptive and gynecological care is an important part of woman’s health, whether able bodied or wheelchair bound. After a thorough literature search, the gap in knowledge with respect to contraceptive use in women who are wheelchair bound was evident. Lack of adequate information and options, inaccessible facilities and examination rooms, and uncertainties about contraceptive care by health care professionals all came to surface by reviewing the literature. The purpose of the study was to explore the experiences of women who are wheelchair bound in attaining contraceptive and gynecological care. In using a focused ethnographic approach, ten women completed an online survey and an unstructured interview exploring their experience in attaining contraceptives, with the health care facilities, their relationship with health care providers, and they were asked about what could be done to better their experience.  Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using a structured 10-step interpretive thematic analysis with constant back checking. Although the women differed in their experiences with contraceptives, they were unanimous in the importance of being in control of their sexual health. The gap in knowledge of the various methods was evident and the women agreed they were unsatisfied with the current contraceptive options they were using. The women deemed the suggestion of more accessible contraceptive information advantageous. Improved facilities, especially examination beds with adjustable heights would significantly benefit the experience of women in wheelchairs in attaining gynecological care. Also, having health care professionals being open and educated about the sexual health needs of women who are wheelchair bound would also be beneficial. The women all desired to have individualized contraceptive care, which would allow them to collaborate with their health care providers and select a contraceptive method best suited to them as an individual.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: One way of “doing” philosophy is to choose a topic of investigation, proceed in depth narrowly on an analysis of that topic; then to apply the results widely. I follow this strategy in my dissertation. The topic I investigate narrowly is “questions”; then I emphasize its applications in epistemology. Since an analysis of questions has consequences for the ways it makes sense to think about knowledge, framing my project in terms of the erotetic epistemology seems natural, though it is novel. 
The best developed erotetic epistemology is contrastive knowledge. Contrastivists about knowledge say ‘knows’ denotes the ternary relation “s knows p rather than q”. The contrastive view thus conflicts with the standard view in epistemology according to which ‘knows’ denotes the binary relation “s knows p”. 
I argue that knowledge within an erotetic framework cannot be contrastive. So, after detailing the contrastive view (Chapters 1 &amp; 2) and its application in epistemology (Chapters 3 &amp; 4), I argue that certain types of questions are clear counterexamples to the contrastive interpretation of the erotetic epistemology (Chapter 6). In route, I defend contrastive knowledge against objection in the literature (Chapter 5).</etd_ms:description>

Cette thèse déconstruit les arguments historiques présentés par Aunger et Munro par l‟entremise d‟une analyse de contenu et d‟une perspective comparée, tout en considérant les contextes interprétatifs qui touchent à la question. La thèse considère également les contraintes et les problèmes qui sont soulevés quand l‟histoire est débattue dans la sphère juridique.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis I consider the role of music in the construction of identity among West African Canadians, focusing on musical taste and performance.  Drawing on themes from participant narratives, I look at how music can maintain connections with or reference identities from “home” cultures.  Focusing specifically on popular music, I suggest that identification with genres such as hip hop and reggae does not directly imply an identification with the African American or Afro-Caribbean cultures from which they originated, rather I point to how the music refers back to West Africa.  I also look at the place of music and religious identity, discussing how performance of religious music embodies multiple registers of individual and communal identity.  Traditional music and dance ensembles provide another focus, and I explore how musicians transmit cultural practices and use their profession to foreground West African elements of their identity in Canada’s multicultural society.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Plant-wide performance monitoring has generated a lot of interest in the control engineering community. The idea is to judge the performance of a plant as a whole rather than looking at performance of individual controllers. Data based methods are currently used to generate a variety of statistical performance indices to help us judge the performance of production units and control assets. However, so much information can often be overwhelming if it lacks precise information. Powerful computing and data storage capabilities have enabled industries to store huge amounts of data. Commercial performance monitoring softwares such as those available from many vendor companies such as Honeywell, Matrikon, ExperTune etc typically use this data to generate huge amounts of information. The problem of data overload has in this way turned into an information overload problem. This work focuses on developing methods that reconcile these various statistical measures of performance and generate useful diagnostic measures in order to optimize process performance of a unit/plant. These methods are also able to identify the relative importance of controllers in the way that they affect the performance of the unit/plant under consideration.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Spatial co-location pattern mining and classification association rule discovery are two canonical tasks studied in the data mining community. Both of them focus on the detection of sets of features that show associations. The difference is that in spatial co-location pattern mining, the features are all spatial features which contain location information. While in classification association rule discovery, we constrain the mining process to generate association rules that always have as consequent a class label. Existing methods on these two tasks mostly use the support-confidence framework in an Apriori-like way or through a FP-growth approach to mine the co-location patterns and classification association rules which require the setting of confounding parameters. However, the lack of statistical dependencies between features in the used framework may lead to the omission of many interesting patterns and/or the detection of meaningless rules. 

To address the above limitations, we fully exploit the property of statistical significance and propose two novel algorithms for these two tasks, respectively. The CMCStatApriori, a co-location mining algorithm, is able to detect more general and statistically significant co-location rules. We use it on real datasets with the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and propose a classification scheme to help evaluate the discovered co-location rules. The second algorithm, SigDirect, an associative classifier, aims to mine classification association rules which show statistically significant dependencies between a set of antecedent features and a class label. Experimental results on UCI datasets show that SigDirect achieves a competitive if not better classification performance while indeed produces a very small number of rules. We also show the potential of integrating statistically significant negative classification association rules in the SigDirect algorithm.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The excessive waveform distortions in the present power distribution systems are produced mainly by the large number of residential loads. Such distributed sources of harmonics cannot be easily treated by the traditional mitigation methods, which have been commonly applied for concentrated and easily detectable industrial distorting loads. 
This thesis presents new harmonic mitigation techniques necessary for managing this new situation. The proposed strategies are supported by several analytical and simulation studies. Different options for both active and passive centralized and distributed filters are investigated and compared to determine their different technical and economic aspects. Overall, the results of extensive studies confirm that the novel zero-sequence harmonic filter and the new scheme of the low-voltage distributed active filters introduced in this thesis are promising solutions for the increasing harmonic problems in residential feeders.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The application of BaCe1-x-yZrxYyO3-δ series solid proton conductors in SOFCs is restricted by the trade-off among the chemical stability, sinterability and electrical conductivity under SOFCs operating conditions. The present research attempted to enhance the chemical stability, sinterability and ensure the high electrical conductivity of BaCe1-x-yZrxYyO3-δ by doping indium. BaCe0.5-xZr0.3InxY0.2O3-δ (where x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) powders were synthesized by a combustion method. The influence of the indium dopant on chemical stability, sinterability, and electrical properties of the sintered samples was investigated. Phase purity and chemical stability were evaluated by XRD. SEM images and a shrinkage plot showed that the sinterability of the samples was improved by the indium doping. The electrical conductivity was measured with an impedance test through a two-point method at both low (200–350 °C) and high (450–850 °C) temperature ranges in different atmospheres. BaCe0.4Zr0.3In0.1Y0.2O3-δ showed the highest electrical conductivity (1.1×10-2 S.cm-1) in wet hydrogen at 700 °C. An anode support fuel cell was fabricated by a spin coating method. A maximum power density of 651 mW/cm2 was obtained when operating at 700 °C and fed by humid H2 and the cell ran stably for more than 100 hours.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Modular construction manufacturing (MCM) is superior to the current on-site construction system which is hampered by inefficiency and material and process waste. Modular buildings are potentially built through a more efficient and cost-effective method, but in the current manufacturing-based approach, a gap still exists between design and production. The increased interest in modular buildings demands special methods of design and manufacturing to support effective production operation. MCM provides opportunity to apply Lean for production efficiency in the plant. Lean is a concept first developed in the manufacturing industry which has been since adapted to the construction industry. Although the focus of Lean in both industries is the same, Lean principles vary between manufacturing and construction since these two industries differ in nature. Lean as the concept is applicable to any industries, taking into consideration that MCM has characteristics of both manufacturing and construction yet is distinct and should be seen in the class of its own. Given the distinct nature of MCM, the technical elements in “Lean production” and “Lean construction” are not sufficient to achieve the Lean goals for MCM industry, necessitating a modified framework by which to exploit the potential benefits of modular building.
The focus of this research is to develop a framework that supports manufacturers’ needs for design and which encompasses the integration of Lean into production process. In this research, Lean is adopted for the MCM industry in order to improve production process efficiency which is introduced as “Lean-Mod”. To apply the proposed Lean-Mod strategies on a factory production line, an enhanced integrated approach of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Lean, and simulation is proposed. Integrating these concepts involves transferring generated data from a BIM model to the manufacturing phase, where Lean strategies are applied, and evaluating the production process scenarios through simulation modeling. The simulation model of production flow evaluates improvement from the Lean point of view and provides assessment of potential scenarios. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study—a residential modular factory located in Edmonton, Canada—and illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Dark matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination will be a tonne scale liquid argon experiment to detect scintillation light produced by interactions with weakly interacting massive particles, leading dark matter candidates. The detector will be constructed out of acrylic and use a spherical array of 266 photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs) to count photons produced by an event and will use properties of liquid argon to discriminate signals from background events. There is currently a smaller prototype in operation underground at SNOLAB an underground laboratory in eastern Canada. The goal of the prototype detector is to understand the sources of background signals in a detector of our design and to validate our method of distinguishing different types of background radiation. The work presented herein is a series of studies with the common goal of understanding the source of background signals, and improving the resolution and efficiency of the detector.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: To aid in reclamation planning for the Genesee Coal Mine in Alberta, I qualified the pre-mined state of wetlands and measured land use and land cover (LULC) change between 1982 and 2007.  A generalized linear model (GLM) was developed to explain the presence of wetlands on the pre-mined landscape.  Environmental variables used to model the distribution of the wetlands included categorical LULC variables (agricultural land, vegetation, roads, structures, rivers, streams and tributaries), and elevation or elevation-derived terrain variables (slope, terrain ruggedness index, compound topographic index, sinks).  Results from the model suggest that pre-mined wetland presence is best explained by agricultural land use, distance to tributaries, terrain ruggedness, distance to rivers, and the interaction between agriculture and roads.  Landscape metrics were used to measure changes in landscape fragmentation and wetland structure. Differences in metric values suggest that the landscape has more surface water, less forested or vegetated land cover, and greater fragmentation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A prototype system which has integrated a linear accelerator (linac) with a magnetic resonance imager (MRI) has been constructed at the Cross Cancer Institute. The real time operation of a linac-MRI system will require proper radio frequency (RF) shielding such that the MRI images can be acquired without extraneous RF noise from the linac. This thesis reports on the steps taken to successfully RF-shield the linac from the MRI such that the two devices can operate independently of one another. The RF noise from functioning multileaf collimators (MLC) is measured using near field probes and MRI images are acquired with the MLC near the MRI. This included measuring the RF noise as a function of applied magnetic field strength. Several measurement and simulation scenarios are discussed to determine the major sources of RF noise generation from the modulator of a linac. Finally RF power density levels are reported internally and externally to the RF cage which houses the linac and the MRI. The shielding effectiveness of the RF cage has been measured in the frequency range 1 – 50 MHz and is presented. MRI images of two phantoms are presented during linac operation. 
The MLC studies illustrate that the small RF noise produced by functioning MLC motors can be effectively shielded to avoid signal-to-noise degradation in the MRI image. A functioning MLC can be incorporated into a linac-MRI unit. The RF noise source investigations of the modulator of a linac illustrate that the major source of RF noise involves the operation of a magnetron. These studies also eliminate the pulse forming network (PFN) coil and the grid voltage spikes on the thyratron as possible major sources of RF noise. The main result is that for linac-MRI systems the modulator of a linac should be housed in a separate RF cage from the MRI.  Finally imaging work with the linac operating illustrates that the accelerating structure of a linac and an MRI can be housed within the same RF cage. The 6 MV linac can be operated to produce radiation with no experientially measurable degradation in image quality due to RF effects.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: INTRODUCTION
Antioxidant micronutrients may help alleviate oxidative stress in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. To determine treatment effect, systematic reviews (SR) synthesize available evidence. Cochrane SRs are known for being methodologically rigourous, however, may have limited
generalizability.

OBJECTIVES
To assess effectiveness of antioxidant micronutrients in CF lung disease using Cochrane and non-Cochrane SR methodology; to determine whether Cochrane SRs trade relevance for rigour 

METHODS
The first SR followed Cochrane-preferred methods, while the non-Cochrane SR employed a broader search strategy and nclusion criteria. Reviews were contrasted regarding yield of search, treatment effect (efficacy and safety) and risk of bias.

RESULTS
Neither SR had enough data to support or refute efficacy or safety of antioxidant supplementation in CF lung disease. Compared to the Cochrane SR, the non-Cochrane SR had four more included studies, more precise estimates of efficacy, additional harms data and a similar risk of bias.

CONCLUSION
Broader search strategies and inclusion criteria may improve relevance of Cochrane SRs without compromising rigour.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In order to better constrain the magnitude of projected sea-level rise from Canadian Arctic glaciers during the 21st century warming, it is critical to understand the environmental mechanisms that enhance surface warming and melt, and how the projected increase in surface melt will translate into increased runoff. Between 2004 and 2010, a 4 °C increase in mean air summer temperature, and a 6.1 day yr-1 increase in melt season duration were observed on the Devon Ice Cap, Nunavut. At the same time, a combination of strengthening of the 500 hPa ridge over the Arctic in June-July, and more frequent south-westerly low-pressure systems in August after 2005 created atmospheric conditions that contributed to an increase in the surface energy balance of the ice cap. At 1400m elevation, these changes led to a doubling of the available melt energy and surface melt between 2007 and 2010. Currently, refreezing of meltwater in firn buffers the relationship between increased surface melt and runoff. Between 2007 and 2012, increased meltwater percolation and infiltration ice formation associated with high surface melt rates modified the stratigraphy of firn in the ice cap’s accumulation area very substantially. Growth of a 0.5-4.5 m thick ice layer that filled much of the pore volume of the upper part of the firn reduced vertical percolation of meltwater into deeper parts of the firn. This progressively limited the water storage potential of the firn reservoir, and likely caused a significant increase in surface runoff. An evaluation of the snowpack model Crocus against ground observations for the period 2004-2012 showed that, although the model simulated observed density/depth profiles relatively well at all sites, its representation of heterogeneous percolation as a homogeneous process created conditions that favoured excessive near-surface freezing. At the same time, Crocus’s parameterization of the permeability of ice layers forced meltwater to percolate through them, preventing the buildup of thick impermeable ice layers. These results highlight the importance of treating meltwater percolation in firn as a heterogeneous process, and of accurately representing the impermeability of ice layers to meltwater flow, if the model is to accurately reproduce firn density profile evolution and surface runoff during periods of climate warming.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major respiratory disorder and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. There is limited information about the burden of disease for COPD among Aboriginal peoples in Canada.
Objectives: To compare the epidemiology and patterns of health services use for COPD between Aboriginal (First Nations peoples, Métis and Inuit) and non-Aboriginal peoples in Alberta, Canada while adjusting for important clinical and sociodemographic factors.
Methods: A systematic review synthesized epidemiological evidence on the prevalence, mortality and health services use for COPD in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations from a variety of settings. Three retrospective cohort studies based on linkage of administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada from April 1, 2002 to March 31, 2010 compared prevalence and incidence rates of COPD between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cohorts in the province, and evaluated all-cause mortality, and rates of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits following a diagnosis of COPD. Poisson regression and Cox’s proportional hazard models were used in the multivariate analysis.
Results: Limited scientific evidence informed differences in COPD prevalence, mortality and health services use between Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal populations. The retrospective cohort studies found that Aboriginal peoples in Alberta have higher prevalence and incidence rates of
COPD than the non-Aboriginal cohort, with Registered First Nations peoples and Inuit having the highest rates of COPD. Overall, all-cause mortality in Aboriginal peoples did not differ from that of non-Aboriginals up to five years after being diagnosed with COPD. Métis and Inuit with COPD had a lower mortality hazard, whereas no differences in mortality were found between Registered First Nations peoples and non-Aboriginals. Given a diagnosis of COPD, Aboriginal peoples had higher hospitalizations and ED visits rates than non-Aboriginals, with Registered First Nations peoples having the highest utilization rates among the three Aboriginal groups.
Conclusions: While Aboriginal peoples in Alberta have a higher burden of COPD than the non-Aboriginal population, the condition affects the three Aboriginal groups differently. Reasons for these differences should be further explored within a framework of social determinants of health to effectively influence modifiable risk factors in each of the Aboriginal groups.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The acquisition of a behavioural response (learning) and the later retrieval of this response (memory) are separated by an endogenous biological process which consolidates the temporary neural changes initiated by training.  Intracerebral infusions of stimulants to the hippocampus potentiate this process and infusions of protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs) impair it.  A tacit assumption regarding the application of PSIs is that they have no effect upon spontaneous brain electrical activity; however, given their documented non-specific side effects, this idea was re-evaluated under controlled conditions. Hippocampal recordings were made in urethane anaesthetized rats before and after unilateral hippocampal infusions of the PSIs anisomycin and cycloheximide.  Infusions suppressed local field potentials, eliminated sink/source alternations and silenced multiunit activity without affecting the contralateral hippocampus.  This suppression was correlated with the degree of protein synthesis inhibition. These results present a serious confound for all results obtained using anisomycin and cycloheximide to test memory consolidation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: We study the mass difference between the spin singlet and spin triplet states of heavy quarkonium. The quarkonium meson is a non-relativistic quark-antiquark bound-state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We set up a matching procedure between the perturbative analysis of the short-distance interactions, and the nonperturbative lattice analysis  of the long-distance effects. To this end, we calculate the part of the corresponding Wilson coefficient in the continuum QCD region, to first order in the strong coupling constant. We then improve upon the first order result by all-order resummation of the large logarithms of the lattice spacing.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Protein folding involves a stochastic search through the configurational energy landscape towards the native structure. Although most proteins have evolved to fold efficiently into a unique native structure, misfolding (the formation of non-native structures) occurs frequently in vivo causing a wide range of diseases. The prion protein PrP has the unique ability to propagate an infectious disease without transmitting any genetic material, based instead on a misfolded conformation which can reproduce itself. The mechanism of prion misfolding and propagation remains unsettled, from details about the earliest stages of misfolding to the structure of the infectious state. Part of the difficulty in understanding the structural conversion arises from the complexity of the underlying energy landscape. Single-molecule methods provide a powerful tool for probing complex folding pathways as in protein misfolding, because they allow rare and transient events to be observed directly. 
We used custom-built high resolution optical tweezers to study PrP one molecule at a time. By measuring folding trajectories of single PrP molecules held under tension, we found that the native folding pathway involves only two states, without evidence for partially folded intermediates that have been proposed to mediate misfolding. The full energy profile was reconstructed for the native folding of PrP, revealing a double-well potential with an extended partially-unfolded transition state. Interestingly, three different misfolding pathways were detected, all starting from the unfolded state. A mutant PrP with higher aggregation propensity showed increased occupancy of some of the misfolded states, suggesting these states may act as intermediates during aggregation. To investigate the mechanism of PrP misfolding further, we characterized the folding pathways of PrP when two molecules interact to form a dimer. Remarkably, the dimer invariably formed a stable misfolded structure, via multiple partially-folded intermediates. We mapped the energy landscape for PrP dimer misfolding and identified a key intermediate that leads to misfolding by kinetically blocking the formation of the native structure. These results provide mechanistic insight into the formation of non-native structures of PrP and demonstrate a general platform for studying protein misfolding and aggregation at the single-molecule level, with wide applicability for understanding disease and biological function.</etd_ms:description>

	This study investigated the pedagogical uses of PowerPoint in education classes among a group of university undergraduate elementary and secondary students.  The study examined the perspectives of pre-service teachers’ personal views of PowerPoint and their perceived academic performance in education classes as the result of PowerPoint. The purpose of the study was to determine how the use of PowerPoint in the classroom is affecting learning among a group of undergraduate elementary and secondary students in university classes. The study utilized a survey research design that employed quantitative methods to obtain data for the study, in which questionnaires were distributed to thirty five students and twenty nine students responded.  Results revealed that eighty six percent (86%) of the students agreed that they enjoyed classes taught using PowerPoint presentations as part of lectures. Findings also showed that most of the students agreed that PowerPoint presentations should continue as part of their lectures.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Abstract
This study was designed to compare reported levels of parenting stress in mothers
of gifted children with mothers of typical children. Mothers of school aged children (Kindergarten to Grade Five) whose children have been identified by a registered psychologist as being gifted through standardized intelligence assessments (n = 30) completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) online. Mothers of children of school aged children (Kindergarten to Grade Five) who self-­‐identified their children having no identified learning exceptionalities (n = 30) also completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) online. The PSI asks participants to respond to statements in two identified major source domains of stressors: child factors and parent factors. Results show that mothers of the gifted sample report significantly greater levels of parenting stress than the mothers of the typical sample. In addition, it was shown that child factors were slightly more predictive of parenting stress than parenting characteristics. The findings point to the importance of identifying areas of parenting stress in families of gifted children so professionals working with these families have a more comprehensive understanding of the unique stressors in raising a gifted child.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A planet's magnetosphere is often very dynamic, undergoing large
  topological changes in response to high speed (~400 km/s) solar wind
  intervals, coronal mass ejections, and naturally excited plasma wave modes.
  Plasma waves are very effective at transporting energy throughout the
  magnetosphere, and are therefore of interest in the context of the coupling
  between solar wind and magnetosphere.  Of relevance to this thesis is
  Kelvin-Helmholtz macro-instability.  Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is
  excited by shear of the flows.  KHI is commonly observed at equatorial
  regions of the magnetopause where fast flowing magnetosheath plasma may
  interact with slow bulk velocities of magnetospheric plasma.  The instability
  is responsible for exciting shear Alfv'en waves which (at Earth) may be
  detected using the ground based magnetometers located at latitude of excited
  field lines.  This thesis uses numerical modelling to understand and to
  explain the generation and propagation of the KHI in Mercury's magnetosphere.
  The instability is initiated close to the planet and convectively grows while
  being transported along the tail.  When the wave amplitude reaches a
  nonlinear stage, the structure of the wave becomes complex due to the
  wrapping of the plasma into the vortex.  A vortex structure is typical for
  KHI and it is used for identifying the wave in the data from satellites.  The
  instability commonly occurs at the dawn or dusk flank magnetopause (MP) of
  Earth with approximately the same probability.  But the data from NASA's
  MESSENGER spacecraft, currently in the orbit of the planet Mercury, suggest a
  strong asymmetry in the observations of KHI.  It is shown that the KHI
  initiated near the subsolar point evolves into large-scale vortices
  propagating anti-sunward along the dusk-side MP.  The simulations are in
  agreement with the third flyby of the MESSENGER spacecraft, where saw-tooth
  oscillations in the plasma density, flow, and magnetic field were observed.
  The observed asymmetry in the KHI between dawn and dusk is found to be
  controlled by the finite gyro-radius of ions, and by MP pressure gradients
  and the large-scale solar wind convection electric field.</etd_ms:description>

Methods: Thirteen participants per group participated. Propulsion kinetic parameters were measured using the Smartwheel. Shoulder pain was assessed using Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain index. A factorial ANOVA was used to determine interaction and main effects of group (acute, chronic) and condition (tile, carpet and ramp).
Results: Participants in both groups were matched for level of injury. There was no significant difference between groups for propulsion kinetics including peak force, push frequency, push length and speed. Push mechanical effectiveness was significantly higher in the acute group. Shoulder pain was significantly associated with propulsion kinetic outcomes in the acute group.   
Conclusion: Our findings suggest individual attention to propulsion kinetics during propulsion training under acute rehabilitation and follow-up programs designed to refine propulsion strategies for people with chronic SCI living in the community.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Rolling resistance is a prime factor effecting fuel consumption of an ultra class haul truck. Capital intensive mining industry has always been interested to reduce rolling resistance of haul roads thus reducing operating costs by saving fuel.
In view of the importance of rolling resistance in movement of ultra class haul trucks on haul roads, commonly used materials sand, oil sand, pit run and limestone were tested. Tests were performed with a scaled truck proportionately fifteen times smaller than ultra class haul truck. Oil sand considered as a base material was capped with other materials and tests were repeated. Results obtained from test data was found to be applicable for ultra class haul truck tire and rolling resistance was estimated.
This research will help in selection of materials for haul roads and quantify rolling resistance in mining industry.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis concerns the study of Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves during magnetospheric substorms.  A wavelet algorithm which characterises magnetic ULF waves during substorm onset is presented.  The algorithm is validated by comparing the spatial and temporal location of ULF wave onset to space-based observations of the aurora.  It is demonstrated that the onset of ULF wave power expands coherently away from an ionospheric epicentre during the substorm expansion phase.
Further, a case study of the time-domain causality of magnetotail plasma flows and ULF wave Pi2 pulsations is presented.   Although highly correlated, it is demonstrated that the plasma flows cannot directly drive the ground magnetic waveforms but may be indirectly linked via a common source.
Finally, results from a statistical study of ULF wave power during onset are presented.  It is concluded that there is no statistical difference between historical sub-classifications of ULF waves observed during substorms.</etd_ms:description>

This qualitative study used purposive sampling to select a total sample size of 10. An interpretive description design was used to analyze the data. Three themes emerged from the study: (a) how they came to be living alone, (b) the impact of living alone at home, and (c) fears associated with living alone in old age. Understanding the factors that influence living alone among older adults will help nurses and other health care providers to reach out to older adults who live alone and others who may be lonely and socially isolated. The implications of the findings will also guide nurse educators and government as they plan the curriculum and policies that will directly or indirectly affect the lives of older adults.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The proposed mechanism in this study is a multi-body cable driven robot. The robot has 6 DOF. The thesis first presents the required concepts and definitions. Then a solution to the kinematic synthesis problem is reviewed. This solution includes an algorithm that finds all the sets of design parameters that make the robot span a desired workspace. Also, an optimization procedure is proposed to find the best possible answer to the synthesis problem. Moreover, a geometrical approach is used to develop a parameter identification method. This task is very important since in practice the fabricated and assembled parts involve errors. More importantly, the robot is supposed to be configured before each performance and the new parameters need to be identified with acceptable accuracy.
Also, Impedance Control is investigated as a method of interest in rehabilitation. The simulation results on a simple shoulder rehabilitation cable robot are presented. The impedance Control makes the robot perform as a mass-spring-damper system. This property lets the patient deviate from the designated trajectory while guiding him towards the right path.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The acoustic characteristics associated with a vowel category may vary greatly when produced by different speakers. Despite this variation, human listeners are typically able to identify vowel sounds with a good degree of accuracy. One approach to this issue is that listeners interpret vowel sounds relative to what might be expected for a given speaker, a theory known as speaker normalization. This thesis comprises three experiments meant to test specific aspects of a theory of speaker normalization that is under active cognitive-control on the part of the listener, where the information used by the process is organized around the detection of speaker changes. The first experiment investigates the role of f0 in vowel perception, with results indicating that f0 primarily affects vowel quality by influencing the listener’s expectations regarding the speaker. In the second experiment, the interaction between the detection of speaker changes and the perception of vowel quality is investigated. Findings support the notion that the detection of speaker changes is a central component of speaker normalization, and that speaker normalization is a cognitively-active process. In the third experiment, listeners were trained to report the acoustic correlate associated with increases or decreases to the average formant frequencies produced by a voice (i.e., formant-frequency scaling). Results indicate that listeners are able to identify voices that differ on the basis of this parameter with good accuracy, and that the perceptual correlate of formant-frequency scaling is influenced by the fundamental frequency of vowel sounds. Finally, a model of cognitively-active speaker normalization, the Active Sliding Template Model (ASTM), is introduced. The ASTM predicts vowel quality on the basis of a speaker-specific representation that is refined in the absence of a detected speaker change, and re-estimated when a speaker change is detected. An implementation of this model was used to simulate the results of Experiments 1 and 2. The results of these simulations indicate that this relatively simple model of cognitively-active speaker normalization is able to generate a range of patterns of results similar to those observed for human listeners.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This work seeks to expand understandings regarding the impact of occupational illnesses and injuries on development.  It identifies a marked lack of attention to the safety of workplaces in international policy, which belies the importance of occupational health concerns in creating sustainable and effective development policies.   Using a materialist epidemiological framework of analysis, I argue that traditional development paradigms have failed to take into account the importance of quality of employment when determining policies for and in the Global South. The case study of the asbestos industry in Brazil is provided to illustrate the physiological, political, and socioeconomic effects that occupational illnesses may have in society.  By examining how family members are affected by their interactions with the Brazilian asbestos industry in those three areas, I identify a far-reaching and under-examined burden created by the presence of unsafe workplaces.  I conclude that development policies that ignore occupational health concerns ultimately serve to perpetuate structured social and economic inequalities and contribute to ongoing poverty in the Global South.  Significant theoretical and practical re-orientations by both policy-makers and researchers are needed if meaningful improvements in development policy are to occur that take into account the importance of workplace quality.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study explored and identified six romantic relationship patterns (long-term relationship, intermittent relationships, emergent relationship, breakup, primarily sexual relationships, and single) across the first year of university in 186 Canadian students assessed at four points. Associations of these relationship patterns with romantic relationship quality (intimacy, affection, and conflict) and adjustment to university (academic and social) were also investigated. Results were that students engaged in a long-term relationship in the first year of university reported higher levels of romantic intimacy, affection, and conflict than those in other relationship patterns at the end of their first year. Relationship duration demonstrated a curvilinear association with intimacy and affection. Furthermore, latent growth modeling revealed that students who engaged in romantic relationships in the first year of university showed better social adjustment at the beginning of the first year than those who were single. Implications of the findings are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: All mammalian cells rely on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain function and for survival. The heart has the highest basal ATP demand of any organ due to the necessity for continuous contraction. As such, the ability of the cardiomyocyte to monitor cellular energy status and adapt the supply of substrates to match the energy demand is crucial.  However, despite having basal energy demands exceeding those of any other organ in the body, cardiomyocytes do not possess large reserves of substrates required to form high-energy.  As such, the heart must rely on exogenous substrate supply to be transported into the cardiomyocytes in order to be catabolized and to produce ATP. Because of this, continuous transport of substrates such as fatty acids (FAs), glucose, and lactate into the cardiomyocytes is a key component of cardiac energy metabolism.  During normal physiological conditions, this production of ATP is met almost entirely (&gt;95%) through oxidative phosphorylation.  Specifically, FA oxidation is responsible for the generation of 50–70% of ATP in a normal adult heart while only 20–30% of the energy provided is derived from glucose and less than 5% from other sources.  Herein, we review the involvement of myocardial FA uptake and subsequent utilization as it relates to cardiac function in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes.  Specifically, we examine the cardiomyocyte-specific role of CD36, a FA transport protein, during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Utilizing an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific CD36 ablation mouse model, we provide genetic evidence that reduced FA oxidation as a result of diminished CD36-mediated FA uptake improves post-ischemic cardiac efficiency and functional recovery.  As such, targeting cardiomyocyte FA uptake and FA oxidation via inhibition of CD36 in the adult myocardium may provide therapeutic benefit during ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, we examine the cardiomyocyte-specific role of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) overexpression during doxorubicin induced cardiac dysfunction.  Our data suggest that chronic reduction in myocardial triacylglycerol (TAG) content by cardiomyocyte-specific ATGL over-expression is able to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction.  We also examine the role of AMPK inhibitory phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase during high workload and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our findings challenge the previously suggested role of AMPK-mediated ACC phosphorylation and inactivation as having a major role in the regulation of substrate metabolism and function in healthy and stressed myocardium.  As well, since diabetes is one of the pathophysiologic processes known to cause alterations in FA metabolism in the myocardium, we further examined the effects of glucose-lowering medication on early outcomes of patients that had and acute coronary syndrome event.  The work presented also emphasizes areas that require further investigation for the purpose of eventually translating this information into improved patient care.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Mobile workers are those individuals who commute to and from resource development projects and who live temporarily in work camps, lodges, hotels, private rental suites, or other short-term accommodations.  My thesis specifically explores the over-stereotyped and under-researched lives of male mobile workers living and working away from home in the industrial mega-project of the Alberta Oil Sands.  The aim of my research is three-fold: 1. to develop a more accurate understanding of the contemporary boomtown context; 2. to gain a fuller, more nuanced understanding of the lived experiences and identities of male mobile workers in the Alberta Oil Sands; and 3. to better understand how the mobile work arrangement affects mobile worker wellbeing.  To elucidate the lived experiences of male mobile workers I used a narrative approach, informed by narrative inquiry and the life story interview.  This study is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 34 research participants.  My research participants comprise three categories: mobile workers (16 in total); key informants in the helping profession (11 in total); and ‘mobile work experts’ (7 in total).  From these narratives, I documented the ‘storied identities’ of mobile workers and explored mobile worker wellbeing as it is conceptualized in the Being, Belonging and Becoming model developed by Dr. Dennis Raphael and colleagues (Raphael et al. 1996, 1997).  Additionally, in following with my narrative approach, and interweaved within my thesis, are what I term ‘narrative threads’.  These narrative threads consist of my own personal stories related to mobile work, as well as stories told by my research participants; together, these stories vividly illustrate and reinforce my key research themes.
My research findings speak to the three research areas that I have described above.  First, to account for the new ‘liquid modern era’ (Bauman 2001a) and the ‘new world of work’ (Beck 2000), I reconceptualize the traditional notion of the boomtown and offer a new boomtown model that specifically centers on the mobile worker’s experience.  The boom-sphere comprises the ‘home-sphere’, the ‘commute-sphere’, and the ‘work-camp-sphere’.  Second, in terms of mobile worker identity, my research reveals that mobile workers generally fall into one of two ‘archetypal’ identities that I conceptualize as existing at two different ends of a sliding continuum. The ‘Thrivers’ – those who are doing fairly well to very well by overcoming the challenges of mobile work, such as being away from family, working long hours for an extended period of time, living in remote settings, on one end; and the ‘Strugglers’ – those who are really struggling with the mobile work lifestyle due to issues related to money, relationships, and substance abuse – on the opposing end.  Third, I identify five key themes related to how the mobile work arrangement affects worker wellbeing.  These themes are: 1. the ‘identity-tension’ and stress experienced by workers as they move along the ‘home-sphere’, ‘commute-sphere’, and ‘work-camp-sphere’ trajectory; 2. the danger and opportunity of high pay (facilitates the accumulation of debt/facilitates the achievement of goals); 3. the identity-limiting and alienating spaces of some work camps that made workers feel like they were in prison; 4. ‘The Oil Comes First’ maxim that was loudly implicit within the work sites during the oil boom and that left workers feeling undervalued, alienated, and feeling like a mere “cog in the machine”; and 5. the ‘Shaking of the Pop Bottle’ phenomenon, which involves some workers putting their mental and physical health ‘on hold’ due to the pressures of shiftwork and due to the ‘Big Boys Don’t Cry’ work culture, and then eventually reaching a ‘breaking point’.  

In terms of the policy implications of my research, I introduce the idea of a Mobile Worker Wellbeing Assessment Tool as a way to assess and improve mobile work environments and, ultimately, as a way to enhance mobile worker wellbeing.  Finally, I identify a number of future research areas, including the need to better understand the relationship between masculinity and worker wellbeing in contemporary resource development settings.

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: To mitigate recurrent and non-recurrent congestion, and to make full use of limited roadway capacity, numerous Active Traffic Demand Management (ATDM) strategies have been proposed, developed and implemented. Segment capacity, a basic input of ATDM predictive models, has been commonly considered a fixed value; however, this consideration does not allow for the probability that complex segment capacity may vary as prevailing traffic conditions vary. Limited research was found that develops analytical models for real-time capacity estimation. This thesis proposes an asymmetric driver behaviour-based algorithm to model multi-lane traffic flow dynamics. By considering car-following and lane-changing behaviours at critical freeway segments, i.e. active bottlenecks and Variable Speed Limit (VSL)-controlled segments, the proposed method obtains real-time freeway operational capacity estimation. The model parameters have been calibrated with field observations taken in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The results show that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates real-time operational capacity at complex freeway segments.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation investigates how collectibles are made meaningful within collecting communities in order to better understand the intricate processes by which lead soldiers, toy trains, dolls, Dinkie cars, Star Wars figurines, and teddy bears come to be so enchanting for their collectors. 
	
An ethnography of toy collecting, including interviews with toy collectors, and observations at toy fairs and gatherings, this project contributes to debates on the use and role of material goods in practices of meaning making and social reproduction. In contrast to theories of material culture, this project aligns itself with consumer theories of the cultural constitution of objects. Emphasizing that object-centered analyses provide little insight on the value of collectibles, it advocates, instead, the centrality of perception and imaginative practice in the hold collectibles come to have over collectors. Drawing from consumer culturalists’ work on processes of identification; Bourdieu’s theory of consumption; Foucault on the archive; as well as Marxist inspired theories of the fetish, this project engages with nostalgic practice, the collectible market, judgments of authenticity, practices of ordering, as well as the complicated rules governing collecting.

Working from collectors’ own stories, debates, contradictions, discussions and imaginative engagements this study uncovers that the mutability of the meanings assigned to collectibles is at the heart of collectors’ enchantment with their collectibles, and a central factor in how collecting becomes an eminently political activity. Collectors are not free to construct meanings for their collectibles at will but subject to community constraints, markets and battles of legitimacy. The various mystifications and social maneuverings present in their collecting practices imply that an object’s value is the outcome of a careful mediation of both personal and wider cultural meanings. Mobilized to particular ends however tenuously held their meanings may be, material goods become powerful components to the wider cultural, social and economic fields in which they circulate.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Myristoylation involves the addition of a 14-carbon fatty acid to the N-terminal glycine of proteins by N-myristoyltransferase. Myristoylation promotes protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions that are crucial for the function of myristoylated proteins. Myristoylation occurs co-translationally on the nascent polypeptide following the removal of the initiator methionine or post-translationally following the proteolytic exposure of an N-terminal glycine. 
Herein, we describe how we employed bio-orthogonal myristate analogs that are incorporated into proteins at N-terminal glycines in an N-myristoyltransferase dependent manner, and subsequently, are chemoselectively ligated to various affinity tags that allowed the facile detection of the myristoylated proteins. These methods allowed the detection of myristoylated proteins by western blotting with exposure times ranging from seconds to minutes (~1-5 million faster compared to the incorporation of radioactive myristate into proteins). 
Ultimately, we identified 7 post-translationally myristoylated proteins during apoptosis.  These include the following caspase cleaved protein products: cell division control protein 6 homolog, cytoplasmic dynein-intermediate chain 2A, Huntingtin (Htt), microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1, the apoptotic regulator induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein, protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) and isoform 1 of YTH domain family protein 2.
Furthermore myristoylated ctPKCε was found to localize to membranes, increase ERK signaling and degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, which prevented a significant loss of mitochondrial potential of 17% over non-myristoylated ctPKCε in HeLa cells in the presence of apoptotic stimuli. Together, this suggests a possible anti-apoptotic role for post-translationally myristoylated caspase cleaved ctPKCε.
In addition, a 34 amino acid post-translationally myristoylated fragment of Htt released by the cleavage of two caspases was found to localize to ER and lysosomes. Moreover, overexpression of myr-ctHttN34-EGFP induced the formation of autophagosome-like vesicles that were associated with cell death in HeLa cells.
Overall, the new tools described within will enable the field of myristoylation by providing methods to rapidly detect, identify and characterize myristoylated proteins. Already, it has nearly tripled the number of identified post-translationally myristoylated proteins and through the identification of myr-ctHtt and myr-ctPKCε, we have shown the relevance of post-translational myristoylation during apoptosis with plausible implications in the pathophysiology of Huntington’s disease.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: β-catenin is a potent oncoprotein that serves as a structural anchor at the adherens junctions and as a transcriptional co-activator of the Wnt Signaling pathway. β-catenin was identified to be post-translationally modified by O-linked β-D-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc). This investigation was aimed to identify Serine 23 (Ser23) as a site for O-GlcNAc modification and to characterize the relevance of this site for β-catenin’s function.
Serine 23 to Glycine mutant or wild-type β-catenin constructs were expressed in DU145 cell line and subsequently treated with PUGNAc—a drug that globally increases O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAc-β-catenin levels were characterized by Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)-HRP or WGA-agarose precipitation. Alterations in β-catenin’s subcellular localization, interactions, and transcriptional activity were analyzed through confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, and, RT-qPCR and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. 
This study demonstrated that Ser23 of β-catenin was a site for O-GlcNAcylation which increased β-catenin’s localization to the plasma membrane and decreased its transcriptional activity within the nucleus.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: An understanding of the ways that rural community dwelling individuals with dementia (IWDs) are, and prefer to be, involved in their decision-making could help caregivers maximize IWDs’ contribution to their decisions and could thus improve their care.  This qualitative secondary analysis used an interpretive descriptive approach to inductively analyze 30 semi-structured interviews, which included 5 IWDs and their 6 informal caregivers (ICGs).  Interviews were conducted over a year at the baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.  Five ways of decision-making were identified: (a) independent, (b) collaborative, (c) guided, (d) delegated, and (e) directed.  Contrary to IWDs’ preference for independent decision-making, they most often made guided decisions.  Guided decision-making was used when IWDs did not recognize their need to make the specified decision, and when the IWD or their ICG perceived that the IWD needed guidance in their decision.  Involvement of IWDs in their decision-making was maximized when their decisions were guided.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of steam and fine solids on coke formation during thermal cracking of bitumen. Experiments in a batch reactor at hydrothermal conditions determined the effects of fine solids and water on the onset of coke formation, total coke yield, and defined the overall conversion to light products of Athabasca vacuum tower bottoms. Removal of fine solids had significant effects on the onset time of coke formation while addition of water played a smaller role. The addition of water had no significant impact on onset time or total coke yield. The yield of cracked products, as determined by simulated distillation, was insensitive to water and fine solids. Based on the findings from this study, residual fine solids have a beneficial effect on thermal upgrading, while water gives little impact. Fine solids allows for longer reaction before coke formation, enabling increased bitumen conversions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Good process control is often critical for the economic viability of large-scale production of several commercial products. In this work, the production of biodiesel from microalgae is investigated. Successful implementation of a model-based control strategy requires the identification of a model that properly captures the biochemical dynamics of microalgae, yet is simple enough to allow its implementation for controller design. For this purpose, two model reparameterization algorithms are proposed that partition the parameter space into estimable and inestimable subspaces. Both algorithms are applied using a first principles ODE model of a microalgal bioreactor, containing 6 states and 12 unknown parameters. Based on initial simulations, the non-linear algorithm achieved better degree of output prediction when compared to the linear one at a greatly decreased computational cost. Using the parameter estimates obtained through implementation of the non-linear algorithm on experimental data from a fed-batch bioreactor, the possible improvement in volumetric productivity was recognized.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are profound, affecting many aspects of cognitive, behavioural, and social development that can be seen in the day-to-day health and functioning of affected individuals. Executive dysfunction has been identified as a particular area of weakness for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Researchers using various neuropsychological tests suggest that children with FASD underperform on many executive functioning tasks; however, they do not tell us which strategies children with FASD are capable of using to aid executive function performance. Observational data was collected on the strategies used by seven children with FASD as they completed cognitively demanding computer games as part of a larger executive function intervention study. Results revealed that children and adolescents used any number of 25 different strategies to aid their executive functioning performance. Furthermore, they were able to increase the number of strategies they used spontaneously and decrease the number of strategies used through prompting over the course of the intervention.  Overall, older participants used more spontaneous strategies and significantly fewer prompted strategies than younger children. These results suggest that children and adolescents with FASD can use a wide and varied battery of executive function strategies that if transferred outside of the intervention setting, could have a potentially positive effect on their daily functioning.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Macramallah’s Rectangle, a single-period First Dynasty cemetery located on the Saqqara Plateau, presents a rare opportunity to re-examine previously published material and construct a deeper understanding of the cemetery and its context. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, this thesis thoroughly explores the aspects of ordinary life in the capital region of Early Dynastic Egypt accessible through mortuary contexts. This analysis focuses in particular on the detailed discussion of sex, age, and status on an individual and group level. Previously, Macramallah’s Rectangle was often thought to be the site of human sacrifice during royal funerary rites. With a more detailed examination of aspects of the cemetery and its context, more prosaic explanations emerge. These prosaicisms build archaeological understanding of a time and people in transition, and explore how that transition translated to the public at large.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study presents the results of a pathological examination of the dental remains of nine individuals from the territory of Cortona (Tuscany), dated to the Late Republican period (first century BC to first century AD). Eight of the individuals were excavated from the area of the Sodo tumuli, Etruscan funerary mounds dating to the sixth century BC, and a single individual from the nearby modern city of Terontola. The sample was examined for caries, abscesses, antemortem tooth loss, calculus, and enamel hypoplasia. Analysis reveals a high prevalence of caries, consistent with an agrarian diet, and enamel hypoplasia, indicative of poor health during childhood. Comparison of these data with those from other studies on Etruscan and Roman populations suggests that although the “typical” Mediterranean regimen of grains, legumes, and olives was consumed throughout the region, significant differences existed between populations in terms of the day-to-day diet.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Viscosity, as a fundamental physical property of bitumen, has been studied
extensively for the past several decades. By and large, nearly all the bitumen
samples used in viscosity measurement were from hot water extraction processes
that were further cleaned by solvents. A drawback of this approach is inevitably
incomplete evaporation of solvent or losses of light ends of bitumen. Such a gain
or loss can have a significant influence on the measured bitumen viscosity. To
accurately understand the role of bitumen viscosity in bitumen recovery by
water-based extraction processes, viscosity measurement of raw (solvent-free)
bitumen is necessary.
In this study, bitumen samples from good ore, artificially weathered good ore,
average ore, and naturally weathered poor processing ore were prepared through
direct centrifugation method. The viscosity of isolated bitumen at different
temperatures and with different solvent (kerosene and naphtha) additions was
measured. A correlation between solvent addition and temperature was
established via viscosity measurements. Based on correlations established in this
study, processability of oil sands was evaluated to identify the critical role of
bitumen viscosity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The significance of poxvirus manipulation of the host ubiquitin proteasome system has become increasingly apparent.  Ubiquitin is post-translationally added to target proteins by a highly conserved enzymatic cascade, typically resulting in protein degradation via the 26S proteasome.  The highly conserved poxvirus protein, p28, is a functional ubiquitin ligase and a critical virulence factor.  Here, we investigate the relationship between p28 and ubiquitination.  We observed that the KilA-N DNA binding domain in p28 targeted p28 to viral factories, where p28 co-localized with conjugated ubiquitin.   Furthermore, we determined that p28 is highly regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.  Disruption of p28 ubiquitin ligase activity revealed that p28 is regulated through auto-ubiquitination and ubiquitination by an additional unknown ubiquitin ligase.  Moreover, we observed Lysine-48 ubiquitin linkages, Lysine-63 ubiquitin linkages and a proteasomal subunit co-localizing with p28 at the viral factory, suggesting an intricate relationship between p28 and proteasomal degradation.</etd_ms:description>

modelling methodology that involves a new geological spatial characterization tool, a geological based spatial distance calculation, and a theoretically sound conditional probability calculation. The full set of bivariate probabilities are  proposed as a  spatial characterization tool  that integrates facies stacking information into the final facies model construction. After inference in the vertical direction from well data, they can be transformed to any spatial distance vector based on a heterogeneity
prototype and the calculation approach proposed in this research. The  data information carried by the bivariate probabilities will be integrated together into a multivariate probability based on the minimum Kullback--Leibler distance. From this estimated multivariate probability, the conditional probability for each unsampled location is calculated directly.
The research developed in this dissertation adds a new 
geostatistical facies modelling approach to currently available tools. It provides a new approach to integrate more geological understanding in the final model. It could be used in practice and as a seed for further development.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The focus of this dissertation is to study the keV X-ray emission from different Z material to develop compact, quasi-continuous tabletop Kα sources for the application of in-line phase contrast imaging, X-ray diffraction experiments and X-ray microscopy. The emission occurs from plasma produced by focusing 120 fs, 800 nm and 300 μJ Ti:Sapphire laser pulses up to an intensity of few times 1016 W/cm2 on Cu, Fe and Ag metal targets. The main interest of these experiments is to characterize the fast electrons and X-ray emission from the laser plasma interaction. The investigation of X-ray emission energy and spectral characteristics is carried out by employing three detector systems which include filtered pin-diode, Charge Coupled Device and CdTe pulse height detectors. Scaling of photon flux as a function of incident laser energy is measured and related to the dynamics and absorption mechanisms involved in laser matter interaction.
Specifically the construction and evaluation of Kα X-ray sources operated at 1 kHz repetition rate is reported with a photon flux of ~ 7×109 photon/s, 3×109 photon/s and 1.4×107 photon/s around the Kα line for Cu, Fe and Ag respectively. These Kα fluences correspond to energy conversion efficiencies of around ηCu = 3×10-5, ηFe = 1.06×10-5 and ηAg = 2×10-7. The Cu and Fe Kα X-ray sources are applied to thin biological specimens and low atomic number (Z) materials to record in-line phase contrast images. It is demonstrated that the laser based Kα
sources can serve as alternative sources for conventional X-ray radiography of biological samples in clinical applications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The project of the Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment consists in providing a ground for judgments of taste so that we are justified in claiming that everybody else can agree with our judgment (‘subjective universality’) and that all others ought to agree with us (‘subjective necessity,’ normativity). This justification is supposed to be accomplished in the “Deduction of judgments of taste.” The section that carries this title (§38) is surprisingly short and for this and various other reasons (some of them textual) commentators have often wondered about the precise location where Kant provides the deduction, whether it is really contained in that short paragraph or whether the argument might actually extend beyond §38. In my thesis, I want to reinvigorate the discussion about the location of the deduction and its interpretation by arguing that it takes place between §30-42.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Voltage-source converters (VSCs) have gained widespread acceptance in modern power systems. The stability and dynamics of power systems involving these devices have recently become salient issues. In the small-signal sense, the dynamics of VSC-based systems is dictated by its incremental output impedance, which is formed by a combination of ‘passive’ circuit components and ‘active’ control elements. Control elements such as control parameters, control loops, and control topologies play a significant role in shaping the impedance profile. Depending on the control schemes and strategies used, VSC-based systems can exhibit different incremental impedance dynamics. As the control elements and dynamics are involved in the impedance structure, the frequency-dependent output impedance might have a negative real-part (i.e., a negative resistance).  In the grid-connected mode, the negative resistance degrades the system damping and negatively impacts the stability. In high-voltage networks where high-power VSC-based systems are usually employed and where sub-synchronous dynamics usually exist, integrating large VSC-based systems might reduce the overall damping and results in unstable dynamics. 

The objectives of this thesis are to (1) investigate and analyze the output impedance properties under different control strategies and control functions, (2) identify and characterize the key contributors to the impedance and sub-synchronous damping profiles, and (3) propose mitigation techniques to minimize and eliminate the negative impact associated with integrating VSC-based systems into power systems. Different VSC configurations are considered in this thesis; in particular, the full-scale and partial-scale topologies (doubly fed-induction generators) are addressed. Additionally, the impedance and system damping profiles are studied under two different control strategies: the standard vector control strategy and the recently-developed power synchronization control strategy. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a simple and robust technique for damping the sub-synchronous resonance in a power system</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Food insecurity is an important public health concern as 2.7 million Canadians live in food insecure households (CCHS, 2004).  My research aimed to explore facilitators and barriers to food security among Latino mothers in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, as research in this realm is limited.
My study used Photovoice, a methodology by which participants express their views through visual means.  Six eligible newcomer Latino mothers were recruited.  The data collected included photographs, transcripts, and field notes.  Data were analyzed using latent content analysis. 
The study findings support the multidimensional nature of food security within the acculturation process of Latino families.  Mothers show resourcefulness in maximizing the household’s resources for finding culturally relevant products. Barriers for accessing these products include limited English proficiency, which is linked to their socioeconomic and psychological adaptation, access to adequate employment and income, and limited flexibility of migration policies. Recommendations for policy and practice are provided.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The traditional approach to the study of consumer behaviour is to regard them as isolated islands of preferences, needs, motives, and goals; however, this approach neglects the impact of ‘others’ on consumers’ judgments and preferences.  For this reason, the theme of this thesis is the ‘connected customer’.
	Chapter 2 and 3 provides a theoretical and empirical treatment of a situation often encountered in households: how do an individual’s private risk preferences translate into preferences over risk when making decisions on behalf of a group of people in which the decision-maker is a member?  It is hypothesized that the decision-maker’s degree of altruism and perception of the group members’ risk preferences are the driving forces in the relation between private and social risk preferences.  The results suggest that social preferences can be characterized as a mixture of individuals’ private risk preferences and the beliefs-private risk differential.  
	Chapter 4 looks at individuals’ information processing strategy under conditions of low and high cultural salience.  Recent findings suggest that consumers in both individualist and collectivist cultures use a dual processing approach—a heuristic versus a systematic processing strategy—when assessing product alternatives.  However, collectivist members tend to rely more on consensus information than attribute.  This chapter examines whether priming individuals on their cultural identity will make them to switch processing strategy toward consensus information and hence become more similar to collectivist members.  The results largely support this prediction.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: With matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP2) deficiency, we observed thoracic aortic aneurysm in 70% of MMP2-/- mice but no abdominal aortic aneurysm following four weeks of angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion. We found markedly suppressed recoil properties in the thoracic aorta of MMP2-/-- Ang II mice. mRNA and protein levels of elastin, but not collagen, were significantly reduced in the thoracic aorta of MMP2-/--Ang II compared to WT-Ang II mice. This reduction in elastin levels was due to significantly reduced TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway that mediates synthesis of extracellular components. Thus, the adverse remodeling in the thoracic aorta of MMP2-deficient mice was associated with decreased synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins without concomitant upregulation of proteolytic activities. These findings suggest a protective role of MMP2 in the development and progression of aortic aneurysm, and as such inhibition of MMP2 may exacerbate vascular remodeling and lead to development of thoracic aortic aneurysm.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Protein phosphatase-1c (PP-1c) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein phosphatase regulated in part by association with a large number of different regulatory subunits. Apoptotic Stimulating Proteins of p53 (ASPPs) are a family of proteins that regulate the apoptotic function of the tumour suppressor p53. In humans, there are three family members, ASPP1, ASPP2, and an inhibitory form, iASPP uniquely overexpressed in many cancers. Whilst iASPP lacks a tetrapeptide PP-1c RVXF binding motif, this work demonstrates that iASPP interacts with PP-1c via a previously uncharacterized“RARL” binding motif. 
Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of PP-1c•ASPP protein complexes identified two novel modes of interaction between PP-1c and ASPP proteins. Firstly, a positively charged region of PP-1c, comprising residues Lys-260 and Arg- 261, was found to be important for binding all three ASPP family members. Secondly, the PP-1c C-terminus was shown for the first time to contain a classic type-2 SH3 poly-proline binding motif (PxxPxR), which binds directly to the SH3 domain of ASPP proteins. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments further demon- strated that a peptide derived from the PP-1c C-terminus alone binds with high anity to iASPP (K=26 nM) and ASPP2 (123 nM). 
The ability of the ASPP proteins to regulate PP-1c mediated dephosphorylation of p53 was examined. Gel filtration chromatography showed that binding between PP-1c, p53, and ASPP1/2 is mutually exclusive. In marked contrast, iASPP formed a stable PP-1c•iASPP•p53 trimeric complex. Dephosphorylation assays further demonstrated that formation of this complex facilitated site-directed dephosphorylation of p53 on residue Ser-15, but not Ser-37. 
The results from this thesis provide support for the PP-1c•iASPP complex as a valuable drug target for cancer therapies. To investigate this, over 150 marine extract leads were tested for their ability to disrupt binding of PP-1c to iASPP, from which three marine compounds were isolated and identified: sokotrasterol sulphate and two novel hippospongin-related compounds.
In conclusion, this PhD thesis provides for the first time a molecular explanation for how p53 may be regulated in part through interaction with iASPP and PP-1c. This study may aid in development of novel cancer therapies that specifically target the association between PP-1c and iASPP.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Widespread tetracycline resistance (TcR) has limited the clinical use of Tc for the treatment of bacterial infections. Tet(O) protein is present in many bacteria and is the major transmissible TcR determinant in Campylobacter jejuni, a common cause of acute bacterial diarrhea worldwide. Tet(O) protects ribosomes against the inhibition of protein synthesis by Tc. Tet(O) binds to the ribosome at a similar site as EF-G, a structural homologue of Tet(O) with GTPase activity that is required for protein elongation. 
EF-G interfered with the kinetics of Tet(O)-mediated Tc release suggesting that EF-G competes with Tet(O) for ribosome binding. Indirect assessment of EF-G and Tet(O) binding to 70S ribosomes by GTP hydrolysis was unable to clearly demonstrate competition for binding. This thesis contributed to the further understanding of the kinetics of Tc release by Tet(O), and may facilitate the development of novel strategies to overcome Tet(O)-mediated TcR in bacteria which cause human infections.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The development of the Diavik diamond mine destroyed pristine lakes and streams in Barrenlands region of northern Canada.  Subsequently, several fish habitat compensation projects were undertaken to offset these losses.  The M-Lakes project was intended to enhance the productive capacity of a pristine headwater lake-stream system through improved stream channel connectivity among three small (&lt;5 ha), isolated lakes and with the much larger (&gt;57,000 ha) Lac de Gras.  Three fishpasses (two gabion-style pool-weir and one nature-like choke-pool) were constructed to enhance inter-lake connectivity in the M-Lakes system.  My objectives were to determine if (1) fish ≥ 150 mm were attracted to and passed through fishpasses, (2) fish use of fishpasses was comparable to reference streams before and after construction and to manipulated streams before construction, and to (3) identify environmental correlates to fish passage events when fishpasses allowed for fish movement.  I used passive integrated transponder telemetry, and visual and electrofishing surveys to address my objectives for one year before (2011) and two years after fishpass construction (2012-2013).  The gabion-style fishpasses limited fish movement and use, while the nature-like fishpass allowed for fish movement and use comparable to reference streams and the stream prior to manipulation.  Few consistent correlates with hydraulic conditions and date were identified for passage events of Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in the nature-like fishpass, relative to the conditions available.  However, I observed strong diel periodicity in Arctic Grayling passage activity as most (95%; 137/144) passage events occurred during evening or early morning (18:00-5:59).  My findings provide evidence against using gabion-style pool-weir fishpasses in low-gradient headwater Barrenlands streams, and demonstrate that nature-like fishpasses can be effective tools for enhancing connectivity in these systems.  Additionally, this thesis documents the first case of clear diel periodicity in passage activity for Arctic Grayling, which may be a response to avian predation given the shallow depth of the fishpass.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study assessed the geographic distribution of mercury in water, and biota of the Athabasca River, and in snow and vegetation in its watershed. Mercury in the snowpack was significantly elevated within 46km of oil sands development relative to greater distances. Mercury was significantly higher in tributaries more disturbed by oil sands development relative to less disturbed watersheds. Mercury in vegetation was elevated near development, but was higher at moderate distances from development, likely due to differences in atmospheric speciation within upgrader plumes compared to speciation within the downwind atmosphere. Mercury concentrations were significantly higher in Walleye, Northern Pike, and Goldeye compared to Lake Whitefish. A large percentage (72-80%) of Northern Pike, Goldeye, and Walleye exceeded the Health Canada fish consumption guideline for frequent consumers. The spatial distribution of mercury within the Athabasca River and its watershed indicates oil sands development is a significant source of mercury within the region.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research describes laboratory and field experiments aiming at developing techniques for obtaining quantitative measurements of suspended frazil ice and surface ice characteristics in rivers using sonars. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to correlate the sonar backscatter signal from a high (546 kHz) and low (235 kHz) frequency units with direct measurements of frazil concentration. The sonar measurements showed that the high frequency unit is more sensitive to the presence of suspended frazil particles than the low frequency unit, especially at lower concentrations. A strong correlation was found between the acoustic relative backscatter from both sonar units and the measured concentrations. This calibration was conducted over a range of frazil mass concentrations between 0.012 and 0.135 % and the majority of observed frazil particles were disk shaped, varying in diameter from 0.25 to 4.25 mm.
An algorithm has been developed to measure surface ice characteristics using field data from the high and low frequency sonars, a 2 MHz current profiler, and a monitoring station, deployed on the North Saskatchewan River in the north east of Edmonton, AB, Canada, during the 2009/2010 freeze-up season. The validity and the accuracy of these measurements were tested and results are presented. Over the entire season, pans/rafts drafts ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 m and pan/raft lengths ranging from 0.6 to 8.0 m were measured. The sonar proved to be very accurate in detecting the exact surface ice conditions locally above the sonar beam.
Acoustic field data gathered during suspended frazil events have been processed and analyzed to provide estimates of frazil concentration and particle sizes using laboratory regression equations and fluid disk scattering model. In total, eight frazil events were detected with the sonars during the field deployment. Preliminary linkages between the meteorological (air and water temperatures) and surface ice conditions measured at the site, and the duration and magnitude of the detected frazil events are presented. Concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 0.05% and disk radii between 0.13 and 0.21 mm have been estimated from the field data.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study explored Canadian nurse practitioners’ (NPs) levels of therapeutic commitment (TC), role competency (RC) and role support (RS) when caring for persons with mental illness and mental health problems. Knowledge and experiential factors that impact these levels were examined and a model of therapeutic commitment was tested. A self-administered mail survey was sent to 1272 NPs from all Canadian jurisdictions except the Yukon, Saskatchewan and Quebec. The survey was comprised of the Mental Health Problem Perceptions Questionnaire (MHPPQ), demographic data and open-ended questions. Using Dillman’s Tailored Design Method, the target population was contacted 4 times: pre-notice letter, first survey, reminder letter, and repeat survey. Of the 1272 potential participants, 680 (57.2%) useable surveys were received. Out of a possible maximum score of 7, NPs reported mean levels of 5.05 (SD 0.83) on the TC, 5.02 (SD 0.88) on the RC and 4.86 (SD 1.27) on the RS subscales. As hypothesized, correlations between the three subscales were demonstrated with RC and TC being the most strongly associated (r = .754, p &lt;.001). A composite variable, Confidence to Manage, which examined NPs’ confidence to manage 7 mental health disorders and suicide ideation was developed. Scores for this variable correlated with TC, RC and RS scores. Feeling ill-equipped to work with this population, knowledge of community mental health services, ratings of relevant theoretical and clinical NP education, previous mental health and NP work experience were all positively correlated with higher levels of the 4 subscales. Differences in categories for population size of the community the NP worked in, frequency of collaboration for psychiatric reasons, time since the NP accessed mental health education and highest level of nursing education were found to impact levels of TC, RS, RC and Confidence to Manage. A large number of NPs reported feeling inadequately prepared to manage the care of persons with mental illness and recommended either adding or increasing mental health education in their NP programs. Most NPs saw the care of this population as part of their role and acknowledged the need for increased support for persons with mental health issues.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Clubroot disease, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, poses a threat to the Canadian canola industry, and breeding of resistant cultivars is urgent. The objective of this study was to identify Brassica germplasm possessing resistance to Canadian P. brassicae pathotypes based on greenhouse screening. Germplasm resistant to local pathotype(s) is the prime requirement for breeding clubroot resistant cultivars. Race-specific to broad-spectrum resistance was identified in the diploid species B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC), and in the amphidiploid B. napus (AACC). The diploid B. nigra (BB) also showed race-specific to broad-spectrum resistance; however, the two amphidiploids with B. nigra as one of the parental species viz., B. juncea (AABB) and B. carinata (BBCC) were completely susceptible. The occurrence of resistance in the diploid and amphidiploid Brassica species is discussed in the light of their evolution, and a differential set for identification of Canadian clubroot pathotypes is proposed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: For successful correction of errors in a digital communication system,
information about the channel, such as timing, noise power, fading gain, etc., should normally be available at the receiver. To this end, most receivers use channel parameter estimation and timing recovery modules. However, these modules are costly in terms of overhead, occupied chip area, power dissipation, and are usually imperfect. Thus, the need for high-speed communication systems motivates finding other solutions.

In this thesis, we seek efficient coding solutions for reliable communication
under limited channel and timing information. We address the problem by considering three important scenarios:

First, we consider Gaussian channels with unknown noise power at the receiver. By using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, we propose a robust decoding method which provides better performance compared to the existing methods.

Second, we consider decoding on wireless fading channels where the fading gain and/or noise power are unknown at the receiver. Most modern error-correcting codes require soft metrics, usually log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), to be calculated at the receiver. This calculation is cumbersome on fading channels especially when the fading gain is unknown. Thus, we first propose an LLR accuracy measure, propose an efficient approximate LLR calculation technique, and then show that the performance under approximate LLRs is extremely close to that of exact LLRs.

Third, we seek practical coding for channels with imperfect timing at the receiver. In vast majority of the coding schemes invented, perfect synchronization is assumed between the transmitter and receiver. In most communication systems, however, achieving perfect synchronization is not possible. This leads to random symbol insertions and deletions in the received signal and poses a great challenge for error correction since conventional error-correcting codes fail at these situations. In this thesis, we propose a practical coding strategy which allows recovering insertions, deletions, and substitution errors without sacrificing the transmission resources.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Regulation of mRNA translation and stability can occur in cytoplasmic compartments known as mRNA processing bodies or P bodies. These compartments contain factors that function in multiple mRNA regulatory pathways and are thought to be centres for coordinating the action of these pathways. One class of proteins that resides in P bodies belongs to the conserved family of GW proteins. Members from this family have been identified only in metazoan genomes and include the prototype human GW182 protein and two additional human paralogues and Caenorhabditis elegans Ain-1 and Ain-2 proteins. In this study, the single Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding a GW protein was characterized. The similarity in structure and function of this gene that were observed in this study, with human orthologues suggest that Drosophila is an appropriate experimentally tractable organism for further advancements in understanding the functions of the human orthologues. This study also contributed evidence supporting the involvement of Drosophila GW in the RNA interference pathway through a physical association with Argonaute 2, an important effector in this pathway. 
A Drosophila strain carrying a mutation in the gw gene showed multiple mitotic defects in homozygous mutant embryos. The mutant strain was named gawky because of the uncoordinated chromatin movements that were observed in live mutant embryos undergoing mitosis. This observation suggests that Drosophila GW may control the stability and/or translation of mRNAs encoding cell cycle regulators. 
The endoribonuclease RNase MRP was chosen as a potential mRNA regulator that may be affected in the gw1 mutant strain. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNase MRP degrades the mRNA of the major mitotic cyclin Clb2 and localizes to a P body-like structure. Human RNase MRP also influences the levels of cyclin B mRNA. MRP RNA, the non-coding RNA component of the RNase MRP enzyme has not been previously studied in Drosophila. In this study, expression of Drosophila MRP RNA was verified. MRP RNA was also localized to a subpopulation of structures containing Drosophila GW during mitosis, suggesting that these two components may functionally interact in regulating mitosis.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study investigates the role hybrid poplar may play in reducing the cost of achieving self-sustaining status in herds of boreal caribou, an ecotype of woodland caribou,  Rangifer tarandus caribou found in northeast Alberta.  Boreal caribou are currently listed as threatened both provincially in Alberta and federally in Canada. As hybrid poplar has a short-rotation and high yields, incorporating their use as a form of intensive forest management might reduce the pressure to harvest in the extensively managed forest which contains caribou habitat. A timber supply optimization model is developed which incorporates both timber values and the rate of change in caribou populations.  As regulations exist which would restrict the use of hybrid poplar on public land, several alternative policy scenarios that relax these regulations are developed. The timber supply model is used to analyze the impact that each alternative policy will have on the net present value of a forestry firm, rates of caribou population change, and the cost of increasing the those rates to a sustained level. The results could contribute to policy discussion surrounding the use of hybrid poplar in Alberta.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: There are growing demands for energy throughout the world. In order to meet the rising energy pressures of the future, renewable sources are required. One approach to resolve this problem is organic photovoltaics (OPVs), which offers a potential low-cost energy solution for the future. Before this technology is commercially feasible, improvements in efficiency, lifetimes, mechanical stability, and processing are required. This thesis presents an integrative approach to investigating the scalability, lifetime stability, and mechanical properties of OPVs.
A robust spray coating method was developed for high conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) transparent electrodes. Conductivities of &gt;1000 S cm-1 are achieved with sheet resistances of 24 ohm sq-1 and 74% transmittance, which are amongst the best-reported in the field. OPV devices fabricated with the high conductivity transparent electrodes yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.2%. Mechanical bending and stretching tests demonstrated that the flexibility of these polymer layers were far superior to that of indium tin oxide (ITO). Collectively, our results illustrate a promising future for the scalable printing of low-cost PEDOT:PSS-based flexible transparent electrodes.
A water-soluble cationic polythiophene derivative was combined with anionic PEDOT:PSS on ITO substrates via electrostatic layer-by-layer (eLbL) assembly. By varying the number of eLbL layers, the electrode's work function was precisely controlled from 4.6 to 3.8 eV. These polymeric coatings were used as cathodic interfacial modifiers for inverted-mode organic photovoltaics. The PCE of the photovoltaic device was dependent on the composition of the eLbL-assembled interface and permitted fabrication of devices with efficiencies of 5.6%. Notably, these devices demonstrated significant air stability, maintaining 97% of their original PCE after over 1000 h of storage in air.
The optoelectronic and photophysical properties of four regioregular poly[3-(carboxyalkyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CAT) with different carboxyalkyl chain lengths (propyl to hexyl) are reported. Each P3CAT is combined with functionalized C60 to form the photoactive bulk heterojunction layer for OPV devices. The extent of hydrogen bonding and polymer crystallinity in the films was determined, and the mechanical properties of films suggested that P3CATs were suitable for use in flexible devices. PCEs of up to 2.6% and 1.6% were obtained for devices on glass and plastic substrates, respectively.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: There are different opinions on who the appropriate decision makers are for extremely premature infants. Some argue the responsibility should fall to the parents, and others argue the neonatal experts should be responsible for decision making. This study explored parental perceptions of their involvement in decision making in the neonatal intensive care (NICU). The NICU operated from the philosophy of Family Centered Care (FCC). FCC situates the parents as central to all aspects of their child’s care and as such, the parents should be well informed and actively involved in decision making. An interpretative descriptive approach was used to examine the experiences of seven parents who had infants born at 24-26 weeks gestation who were admitted to the NICU. Thematic analysis revealed that the culture of the NICU along with the relationships developed in the NICU had an impact on the parents’ perceptions of decision making.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Arc-continent collisions are a fundamental plate tectonic process that control continental growth, orogen development and the distribution of natural hazards and natural resources. This process actively occurs in Taiwan where the Luzon Volcanic Arc collides obliquely with the passive margin of the Eurasian Plate. An important characteristic of the arc-continent collision in Taiwan is that oblique convergence has produced an orogen that decreases in age from north to south. Investigation of the temporal evolution of the Taiwan orogen is therefore made possible through studies at different latitudes on the island. 

The first long-period magnetotelluric (MT) measurements in Taiwan were recorded at 82 locations on three profiles across south, central and north Taiwan during 2006-2007. These MT data were collected as a component of the TAIGER (Taiwan Integrated Geodynamics Research) project and are analyzed and interpreted in this thesis. The TAIGER project was initiated to: 1) collect multi-technique high resolution geophysical data required to unambiguously distinguish between end-member tectonic models proposed for central Taiwan, and 2) to investigate the orogen evolution by comparison of data collected at latitudes ranging from south to north Taiwan.

In this thesis, the central Taiwan TAIGER MT data are shown to be inconsistent with orogen-scale thin-skinned tectonic models and instead support predictions of lithospheric-scale deformation (i.e. thick-skinned tectonics) beneath the Central Ranges. Similarity between resistivity models of central and southern Taiwan indicate that thick-skinned tectonics is occurring in both locations, and is therefore a persistent mode of deformation that operates as the orogen develops. The resistivity model for northern Taiwan is shown to be consistent with dewatering of the subducting Philippine slab, and with deformation described by the subducting indenter tectonic model.

A global context for the Taiwan results is provided by comparison to the South Island of New Zealand that shares many similarities with the tectonic setting in Taiwan. MT resistivity models support lithospheric deformation beneath the Southern Alps, and the occurrence of fluid-based conductors in the Marlborough region caused by dewatering of the Pacific slab.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Over the last two million years, the evolution of North American tree species, subspecies, and genetic varieties has taken place in a constantly changing landscape often dominated by extensive ice sheets and restricted temperate climate environments. Here, I approximately reconstruct post-glacial vegetation histories and glacial refugia of western North American trees using species distribution models to test biogeographic hypotheses regarding the existence of glacial refugia in Beringia, the evolution of subspecies in widespread conifers, the origin of Pacific Northwest inland rainforests, and levels of modern genetic diversity. The first two chapters have a methodological emphasis, where I select and test a variety of species distribution models for their accuracy and robustness. Validations against 3,571 pollen and fossil records from 835 study sites indicated fair accuracy for most techniques (AUCs around 0.75). Ecosystem-based modelling approaches outperformed in specificity statistics and robustness against extrapolations far beyond training data, suggesting that they are well suited to reconstruct historical biogeographies. Evaluations at the biome level indicated that species distribution models could approximately reconstruct biomes for the mid- to late-Holocene but became unreliable in the Late Pleistocene due to the emergence of no-analogue climates. However, the limitation applied primarily to non-forested biomes. Using a set of three robust species distribution modelling techniques, I investigate how modern genetic diversity and genetic structure was shaped by refugial history, using published estimates of allelic richness and expected heterozygosity for 473 populations of 22 tree species. Species with strong genetic differentiation into subspecies and varieties had widespread and large glacial refugia, while species with restricted refugia showed no differentiation and little genetic diversity. In a regression tree analysis, 66% of allelic richness could be explained by the total size of glacial refugia, while expected heterozygosity was best explained by the number of glacial refugia. A comparison of projected past and future habitats showed that future migration requirements were much faster than, but highly correlated with, past migration requirements a cross 24 tree species. Populations in certain localities may be at risk of maladaptation due to the inability of gene  flow to keep pace with the migration of climate habitats.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In order to meet the availability requirements of modern communication networks, a number of survivability techniques were developed that adapt the demand-wise shared protection design model to incorporate strategies increasing network availability.  The survivability methodologies developed took two approaches.  The first incorporated availability directly into the network design model.  The second ensured minimum dual failure restorability was set within the model.  These methodologies were developed for predetermined topologies, as well as to have topology optimization incorporated into the model.
All methodologies were implemented and analyzed on a set of samples.  The analysis examined cost, topology and actual availability of the network designs. Availability design was effective but computationally intensive and difficult to design.  Minimum dual failure restorability was also effective in increasing availability with a significant caveat, dual failure restorability increased exposure to possible failures, and without sufficient levels of dual failure restorability could have a negative impact on availability.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Vitamin D (vitD) is a nutrient of concern in Canada particularly for those with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Participants (18-80y) with diabetes and CKD were randomized to receive either 50mcg/day (n=33) or 1,000mcg/month (n=30) vitD3 for 6-months. Variables studied included: anthropometric/demographic data, routine clinical blood work, serum/plasma 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, bone turnover markers (BTM), and vitD intake. No significant differences in clinical characteristics between groups or study visits were observed (p&gt;0.05). Adherence to daily and monthly supplementation was 93% and 100%, respectively. Mean 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations increased in both groups after 6-months; but significant increases in 25(OH)D were seen only in the daily group (78.4 to 95.1nmol/L; p=0.01). There were no significant differences between groups over 6-months in PTH or BTM (p&gt;0.05). This suggests that both once daily and once monthly vitD supplementation strategies are equally effective at influencing vitD status despite differences in adherence.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: An important contribution of the Semantic Web is a new format of data representation called Resource Description Framework (RDF). In RDF every piece of information is represented by a triple: &lt;subject-property-object&gt;. RDFs are densely interlinked between each other and are becoming very popular format of representing data on the web. As of August 2011, the last available data, more than 31 billion of triples exist on the web. In this set of work, we propose a system for information extraction from plain text in form of RDF triples. The proposed method is independent of prior knowledge-base and domain-specific patterns, and is applicable to any textual resources. Our approach is capable of identifying grammatical structure of an input sentence and analyzing its semantic to generate meaningful RDF triples of information, readable by human users and software agents. Through several experiments, we evaluate this approach by demonstrating the quality of our results.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The physical and kinematic properties of frazil ice particles have proven difficult to measure with any accuracy in the past.  As a result, little is known about the size distribution, thickness, aspect ratio, and rise velocity of these particles, making it impossible to develop accurate mathematical models of the formation, development, and transport of frazil ice.  To address this lack of data, a digital image acquisition system was developed capable of capturing high-resolution, cross-polarised photographs of suspended frazil ice particles in a laboratory environment.  An algorithm was written to process these images and calculate the diameter of individual particles.  A lognormal distribution was found to offer a good fit to the particle diameters.  This image acquisition and processing system was also applied to rising frazil ice particles and the effects of particle thickness, diameter, aspect ratio, and orientation on the rise velocity of frazil ice in quiescent water was studied.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Canadian Nurses Association predicts the nursing shortage will rise to an estimated 60,000 Registered Nurses (RNs) by the year 2022.  Further compounding this issue is the approximate 14-61% of nursing graduates who will change nursing roles or exit the profession within two years of practice.  Using the Glaserian grounded theory method, the purpose of this study was to examine the basic psychosocial process labelled Letting Go involved in how newly-graduated RNs in western Canada arrive at the decision to exit the nursing profession within five years of entry into the workforce through semi-structured interviews.  The study findings revealed the following themes: Navigating Constraints of the Healthcare System and Workplace; Negotiating Social Relationships, Hierarchies, and Troublesome Behaviours; Facing Fears, Traumas and Challenges; and Weighing Competing Rewards and Tensions.  This study adds to a growing body of knowledge to understand new RN attrition from the profession.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to investigate the character of the basement rocks beneath the oilsands region around Fort McMurray in the context of developing engineered geothermal systems (EGS). Magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected at 94 stations on two profiles near to Fort McMurray and initial inversions showed that while these data exhibited strong 2-D character, an isotropic analysis of the MT data was not possible. Forward modeling of 2-D anisotropy showed that the basement below a depth of 4 - 5 km is electrically anisotropic with a resistivity ratio close to 1000. It was also shown that certain features of MT data commonly interpreted with a 3-D model could be explained with 2-D anisotropic model. The source of the anisotropy was interpreted to be due to interconnected graphite films oriented ~S27E within the metamorphic basement rocks. This direction is reasonably close to the current minimum stress direction of ~S40E, the interaction between the rock MT-interpreted rock fabric and the stress direction will control the propagation of artificial fractures.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Apoptosis, an evolutionarily conserved cell death programme, is a potent barrier against virus infection.  Central to this process are mitochondria, which harbour cytochrome c and other apoptosis-inducing factors.  Once released, these factors activate a caspase cascade that culminates in cell death.  Mitochondrial integrity is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are united by the presence of one or more conserved Bcl-2 homology, or BH, domains that are critical for protein interactions and function.  Bak and Bax are the key pro-apoptotic members that engage the mitochondrial death machinery to release cytochrome c.  These proteins are activated by pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and inhibited by anti-apoptotic family members, such as Mcl-1.  Due to the importance of Bak and Bax, many viruses, including poxviruses, have adapted strategies to interfere with the activation of these two proteins.  In the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia virus, this is accomplished by a unique anti-apoptotic protein, F1L.  F1L localizes to mitochondria and prevents apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli.  This is achieved by direct binding to Bak, while Bax inhibition is believed to occur by the binding of F1L to the BH3-only protein, BimL.  However, the way in which F1L binds Bak and BimL is unknown, since F1L lacks sequence homology to Bcl-2 proteins.  Here, we show that F1L functions in a manner that resembles Mcl-1, the major cellular regulator of Bak.  Moreover, we have identified divergent BH domains within F1L that are critical for Bak binding and anti-apoptotic activity.  Given the importance of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, many members are regulated by ubiquitination, which targets the proteins for proteasomal degradation.  Similarly, we have discovered that F1L is tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  Our studies on F1L ubiquitination have also revealed a potential role for F1L in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Thus, despite divergence at the sequence level, F1L interacts with Bak in a manner nearly identical to cellular Bcl-2 family members, and, additionally, F1L is governed by the same regulatory mechanisms that control members of the Bcl-2 family.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The radiation dose and the associated lifetime risk of developing cancer is a problem justifying the use of surface topography (ST) as an alternative to radiographs for monitoring scoliosis. The current ST methods mainly rely on marker placement and fail to describe the 3D aspect of the scoliosis deformity. This thesis describes research and development of a novel method for assessing, quantifying, and monitoring the torso deformities based on their symmetry and curvature. 
We present a new 3D asymmetry analysis that discloses the area of abnormality in a geometry using contours of deviation. Its application in biomedical image analysis of torso to quantifying and monitoring torso deformity is described. The deformity pattern of the analyzed torsos are categorized using the classification system. The reliability of the classification system along with its correlation to the radiograph measurement are investigated. 
Internal characteristics observed in radiographs such as magnitude, number, and location of the scoliosis curve are estimated using the ST measurements. The difference of ST measurements between two successive acquisitions, with one year gap between, is used to determine the change of the thoracic/thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis curves. The capability of the ST measurements in classifying the scoliosis curves into progression and non-progression group is assessed with the aim of replacing some of the X-ray acquisition used to monitor patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are complex and interesting objects of study. They are quite popular among both casual and connoisseur gamers, and they are often played continuously over many years. Despite a reasonable amount of existing research on MMORPGs, no clear explanation has emerged to explain what particular game features encourage so many players to enjoy these games for so long. In this thesis, I contend that the most important elements in the success of an MMORPG are meritocratic play and managed player efficiency (MPE). This contention is proved by examining the existing literature on player enjoyment and game design, surveying popular MMORPGs, and building and testing a simple, browser-based game that implements meritocratic play and managed player efficiency. While existing research and my survey of popular MMORPGS provide good support for the importance of meritocratic play and MPE, participants in my study provided much stronger support by reporting particular enjoyment of game tasks that displayed the clearest meritocratic play and the best opportunities to manage player efficiency.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The history of free and open source software (FOSS) spans the better part of 20 years. We are now seeing the principles of FOSS spread to different media - including, notably, to hardware and its distribution models. Recently, the term open source hardware (OSHW) was defined at the 2011 open hardware summit.
OSHW has the potential to redefine the way that goods are designed, transported, and consumed. Accordingly, researchers in the humanities and digital humanities in particular should pay attention and take advantage of this potential area of research.
This thesis first provides a basic understanding of open source software including its history, definition, and business models. Next, it explores how open source ideas are applied to hardware as well as the history, critical issues, and future of OSHW. Finally, it presents a research project undertaken as a case study for how the digital humanities may use OSHW in research.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Helicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a challenging control problem since their dynamics are nonlinear, underactuated and non-minimum phase.  Although it is inherently an applied research field, due to the difficulty of building and maintaining an experimental platform relatively few experimental results exist in the literature.  The approach followed in this thesis is to combine rigorous analysis with thorough experimental testing.  This testing ensures validity of the designs.  We present our experimental platform which is designed to be flexible so that it can accommodate nonlinear control research.  Existing accounts of helicopter testbeds focus on hardware details.  Since autopilot software design and development also requires a significant investment, we describe our implementation which has been released as open source for the benefit of the community.  Due to the intractability of existing helicopter models, many control designs use non-physical inputs.  We propose simple, invertible expressions relating the non-physical inputs to the physical inputs.   In particular, modelling of the main rotor typically results in complicated expressions with extensive state dependence.  While it is unlikely that angular velocity has a significant influence on the thrust, we show using experimental results that previous attempts to simplify this expression using a hover assumption are invalid during vertical flight.    The platform is validated using a model-based PID control law.  This control is derived using passivity to ignore nonlinear terms which do not affect stability.  Among the class of vehicles with similar flight capabilities, helicopters possess a coupling between the rotational inputs and translational dynamics which is unique.  This coupling is sometimes referred to as the Small Body Force (SBF) and is ignored in the literature for controller synthesis.  We derive an experimentally-validated control design which accounts for the effect of the tail rotor in the SBF.  In addition, we show why the contribution of the main rotor flapping in the SBF cannot be compensated using the same approach, and give a robustness analysis of their effect on the closed-loop.  Finally, based on recent results we propose a control design which accounts for state constraints by enforcing bounds on translational velocity and roll-pitch travel.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study seeks to establish a working definition of contributions, related to older adults, from the perspective of stakeholder groups (elders, caregivers to elders, practitioners, and policy makers). A secondary content analysis was conducted on 4 group interviews of stakeholder groups. Findings supported the conceptual framework of the Welfare Diamond, whereby elders make contributions to various sectors that constitute society. Further, stakeholders identified invisible contributions, as well as the darker side of making contributions, as important elements of contribution. Findings help to establish an inclusive definition of contribution and to highlight where more research may be needed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: K63-linked polyubiquitin is synthesized by the E2 Ubc13, and plays non-degradative roles in immunity and the DNA damage response, yet a full molecular understanding of its synthesis and subsequent recognition remains incomplete. Although previously considered a slow enzyme, we demonstrate that Ubc13 is able to achieve a significant rate enhancement in synthesis of K63-linked Ub2, even in a putative off-state. Using a non-steady state kinetic approach to measure K63-linked polyUb formation, we are able to measure a true, rather than apparent, kcat for Ub2 formation. Accurate knowledge of this value provides mechanistic insight that would otherwise remain obscure. These non-steady-state approaches provide the groundwork for quantitative measurement of the activated E2 in the presence of E3 enzymes, the latter currently thought to function in activating their cognate E2s.

In response to DNA double strand breaks, K63-linked polyUb is synthesized on adjacent histones. RAP80 recognizes these chains using ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) and recruits downstream repair proteins. The presence of tandem UIMs and multiple Ub molecules tethered together in the chains leverages multivalency to increase the affinity. We use a novel combination of NMR methods and thermodynamic binding models to dissect these complex interactions to develop a molecular basis for signal amplification through multivalency.

For interactions characterized by relatively fast kinetics, NMR is a powerful method for determining binding thermodynamics. We developed two novel methodologies which increase both the accuracy and precision of thermodynamic values obtained from NMR chemical shift titrations. These are sampling schemes in which the concentrations of analyte and titrant are varied simultaneously. Simulations are used to demonstrate the potential for increased accuracy and precision while titrations of Mms2 with ubiquitin demonstrate the experimental feasibility.

Whereas chemical shifts provide thermodynamic information, the full line-shapes conceal kinetic information. We demonstrate that classical line-shape analysis allows for determination of kinetics over a broad range of biologically relevant exchange rates, which can be widened using our sampling methods. This provides the opportunity of accurately and precisely quantifying both thermodynamics and kinetics from a single NMR chemical shift titration.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Few studies have been carried out to determine the odour intensity retained on fabrics, particularly for antimicrobial treated textiles. The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro method to collect human axillary odour on fabrics and compare this to the traditional in vivo method (i.e., wear trial); and also to investigate axillary odour intensity emanating from cotton and polyester fabrics without treatment and with antimicrobial treatments of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and zinc pyrithione (ZP). Sensory measurement with line scale was used to determine the odour intensity retained on fabrics. Numbers of aerobic bacteria extracted from fabrics were counted to determine the effect of antimicrobial treatment. Findings suggest that odour can be generated and detected through the developed in vitro method by incubating ‘fresh sweat’ onto fabrics. However despite a reduction in bacteria due to the antimicrobial treatments they do not correspond to anti-odour as bacterial counts were not related to differences in odour intensity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of bubble-particle interactions plays a critical role in advancing flotation technology. In this study, submicron size bubbles with an average diameter less than 1 μm and a life time of at least several hours were generated using a novel hydrodynamic cavitation method. Effect of mechanical force and water chemistry on generation and stability of submicron size bubbles is investigated.
      With recent development in measuring zeta potential distributions of colloidal systems, interactions of bubbles and fine solid particles in various electrolyte, surfactant and frother solutions as well as in industrial process water were studied using the stable submicron size bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation. The outcome of this study provides not only a better understanding of bubble-particle attachment mechanism and its role in flotation, but also a direct evidence of armour-coating of bubbles and enhanced bubble-particle interactions by in situ gas nucleation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Financing and implementation of malaria control measures expanded vastly over the past decade, leading to substantial reductions in global malaria morbidity and mortality. Yet malaria still threatens health and socio-economic development among the poorest populations particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where limited health systems capacity hampers effective control. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to reduce the disease burden. Expert microscopy - the gold standard for malaria diagnosis - is unsustainable in remote settings with limited laboratory infrastructure. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) enable parasite-based diagnosis in these settings and are widely deployed across sub-Saharan African countries including Ghana. However, presumptive treatment based on the presence of fever persists across the region, leading to rampant over-diagnosis of malaria and consequent over-consumption of antimalarials. Inappropriate antimalarial use contributes to emerging drug resistance, threatens the feasibility of expanding treatment access among affected populations, and undermines the effectiveness of malaria control measures. 

The World Health Organization recommends diagnostic confirmation of suspected malaria cases prior to antimalarial treatment. Ghana adopted this guideline in 2009 and employed RDT use to support guideline implementation. However, RDT use is beset with operational challenges including poor compliance among healthcare providers with the test-before-treat guideline. Poor compliance has been reported in Ghana and is widespread across sub-Saharan Africa. Although guideline compliance is central to the successful implementation of test-based malaria management in these settings, its underlying factors are barely understood. 

In this thesis, I investigated healthcare providers’ compliance with the test-before-treat guideline for malaria in Ghana. I present this research in three consecutive and complementary papers. Chapter 1 comprises a review of the literature on barriers and facilitators regarding RDT use for malaria diagnosis across sub-Saharan Africa. In Chapter 2, I illustrate the significance of the qualitative approach I employed to investigate guideline compliance for confirmatory malaria testing in Ghana. In Chapter 3, I identify and explain the determinants of guideline compliance from the healthcare providers’ perspective. Uncomplicated malaria in Ghana is managed within the jurisdiction of primary healthcare. The findings of this research therefore pertain to improving guideline compliance for malaria management within primary healthcare settings in Ghana.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Estimation theory is a branch of statistics and probability that derives information about random variables based on known information. In process engineering, state estimation is used for a variety of purposes, such as: soft sensing, digital filter design, model predictive control and performance monitoring. In literature, there exist numerous estimation algorithms. In this study, we provide guidelines for choosing the appropriate estimator for a system under consideration. Various estimators are compared and their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. This has been done through case studies which use examples from process engineering. We also address certain robustness issues of application of estimation techniques to chemical processes. Choice of estimator in case of high plant-model mismatch has also been discussed. The study is restricted to unconstrained nonlinear estimators.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects 350 million individuals worldwide, leading to mortality by end-stage liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The vaccine to prevent HBV infection is highly effective but is not extensively available in endemic areas, resulting in high infection rates. Nucleoside analogue treatment of HBV has allowed for higher rates of viral clearance in infected individuals, but most patients must remain on therapy long term and viral resistance to the drugs is growing. 

The HBV viral genome is an episome in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. It is called covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA and is highly stable, has a long half-life, and is the template for all viral transcription and progeny production. Nucleoside analogues do not directly target cccDNA, therefore many patients experience rebound when antiviral therapy is stopped. I have designed novel DNA binding proteins called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) to specifically bind to the cccDNA in infected cells and inhibit viral transcription. Seven ZFPs targeting the model duck HBV (DHBV) and ten ZFPs targeting HBV were developed. Kinetic analyses of the purified ZFPs were performed, characterizing their specificity and binding properties. Using the DHBV tissue culture model system, I have demonstrated that the DHBV-specific ZFPs can specifically inhibit transcription from the viral template, resulting in reduced viral RNA, protein products and progeny virions. The DHBV-specific ZFPs were tested in primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) and in vivo in the Pekin duck model. ZFPs failed to express in PDH transduced by baculovirus vectors when DHBV was present in the cells. In vivo gene delivery of the ZFPs was carried out by portal vein injection of chitosan-based nanospheres. Unfortunately, non-specific reductions in viral levels masked any direct effect by the ZFPs. Testing of the HBV-specific ZFPs in tissue culture was hindered by a lack of transfectable cell culture model. A number of different transfection methods were tested to express the HBV-specific ZFPs, all without success. Further work is being carried out using baculovirus vectors to deliver the HBV-specific ZFPs to HBV-harbouring cell lines and HBV-infected scid-Alb/uPA chimeric mice with human liver cells.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The passivity and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of Alloy 800 was studied in test solution containing thiosulfate and sulphide species. Cyclic polarization experiments in thiosulfate containing solutions indicated that with an increase in the concentration of thiosulfate, both the pitting potential and the passive range were decreased. The presence of deflection promoted material degradation. Cyclic polarization test in solution containing sulphide indicated that Alloy 800 was susceptible to anodic dissolution. Mott-Schottky results showed that the donor density of the passive film increased with an increase in the concentration of low valence sulphur species.
The SCC of Alloy 800, with an applied deflection of 0.356 mm, was studied under different applied potentials in test solution containing 0.075 M thiosulfate. Alloy 800 was susceptible to SCC in transpassive potential region (-110 mV). The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis showed that the degradation of the passive film caused by the reduction reaction of thiosulfate was the cause of Sy-SCC.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis, I explore the artworks of Abdulnasser Gharem and situate them within the genre of social practice. I isolate three features to examine in conjunction with Gharem’s works. My first chapter draws on performance scholar Shannon Jackson’s theories to address the roles of support and spectacle in creating social artworks. Secondly, I address concepts of site-specificity as put forth by academic Miwon Kwon to examine the importance and multiplicity of site. Finally, my last chapter looks at dialogic art as explicated by professor and researcher Grant Kester to unfold the role of dialogue in socially engaged artworks. These three components of performance, site-specificity, and dialogue contribute to enhancing community life which Gharem strives to undertake through his artworks.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Conaid is a liquid ionic soil stabilizers used as a compaction aid or a stabilizer for soil improvement. The material is a mixture of surfactant, stabilizer and high-charge ion sulfide compound. This product may have the potential benefits of removing absorbed water from soil particles with the aid of compaction which results in an increase in shear strength. Despite these potential advantages, there is a lack of geotechnical testing on the material as well as knowledge on its chemical composition and field performance.  As a result, a laboratory testing program was conducted at the University of Alberta between September 2010 and June 2012. 
In this study, standard ASTM laboratory tests were carried out to examine the potential benefits of Conaid. Two natural soils and two clayey soils (kaolinite, montmorillonite) were selected for this study. A wide range of Conaid contents, varying from 0.01% to 0.5% by weight, were applied in treating soils. The effects on the compaction characteristics, shear strength and volume change in triaxial compression tests were evaluated. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the microstructure of untreated and treated soil samples.
The test results show some changes, negligible in some cases, on the mechanical properties of the soils treated with Conaid. Also, both Standard and Modified Proctor compaction tests show negligible or even negative effects on maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of test soils except for kaolinite. However, no significant, consistent increases in the shear strength are observed from consolidated drained triaxial compression tests and unconfined compression tests. There is no obvious alteration in the microstructure of the treated soils when they are examined using a SEM except some minor changes are noted in the soil structure.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study began by exploring the factors that influence the sexual health information sources available to Ugandan adolescents and how they decide what sources to use. Guided by participatory action research, focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with students and teachers from two secondary schools in western Uganda. In addition to external barriers, the young people had a complex internal process that they applied when choosing sources. Using these findings, the participants collaborated to develop and initiate a school-based peer education program to prevent unwanted sexual health outcomes (HIV, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections). The peer educators received participatory training on sexual health topics. Through their involvement in the project, peer educators felt prepared and confident to be peer educators and had already had opportunities to provide advice to their peers. The students continued the peer education program; it expanded to other schools where successes were also achieved.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Many adult concepts can be represented in taxonomies – hierarchical systems in which concepts are differentiated into varying levels of abstraction (e.g., musical instrument, wind instrument, flute) related by class inclusion (a flute is a wind instrument and a wind instrument is a musical instrument). Indeed, most natural kinds (e.g., whale, tree) and artifacts (e.g., flute, truck) are generally believed to fall within taxonomies. Moreover, in real world contexts, concepts are probably rarely learned as explicitly contrasting sets existing completely outside of known taxonomies (that is, one might not learn cats vs. dogs without also learning that both are types of animals, and that both include more specific subcategories). Surprisingly, relatively little research has been done on the learning of categories that are hierarchically structured. The present study began an investigation into how adults learned new concepts that are hierarchically structured. In Experiment 1, participants learned to classify items at one taxonomic level then at a later time classified items at either the same or a different level. The results suggested that people were unable to clearly detect the relationship among alternate levels of the hierarchy prior to exposure of those levels. However, results in Experiment 1 also suggested that learning multiple categories might lead to deeper understanding of how features transfer or generalize to higher taxonomic levels. The remaining experiments addressed more explicitly the influence of hierarchical structures on category learning by including prototype and control items, along with artificial and knowledge-based category labels. Results from these experiments indicated that, at least within the parameters of this study, prior experience cued by knowledge-based category labels interacted adversely with abstract materials and interfered with mapping of item information to categories.  Moreover, when the relationship between categories and item information is unclear, generalization might be one important means by which people categorize.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: One of the aspects of climate change is global warming, which can be defined as the increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s near-surface air and the oceans and its projected continuation. Scientific understanding of the cause of global warming has been increasing. In its fourth assessment of the relevant scientific literature, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that scientists were more than 90% certain that most of global warming was being caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) produced by human activities. Common GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. 

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic GHG that has significant contribution to the climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions come mostly from fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land use changes such as deforestation. Ways to lessen the environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion technologies, which currently comprise a substantial portion of the planet energy supply, are being evaluated internationally. One promising option is carbon capture and storage (CCS).

CCS involves capturing CO2 emissions from large point sources and storing them underground in suitable geological formations. The process of storing CO2 is defined as geological CO2 sequestration or CO2 geo-sequestration. Suitable geological formations include declining oil reservoirs, un-minable coal seams, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and saline formations. Storage options such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for declining oil reservoirs and enhanced coal-bed methane (ECBM) recovery for un-mineable coal seams provide short-term storage opportunities. On the other hand, storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline formations can be considered longer-term options.

The storage of CO2 is not risk-free, but if it is properly planned, operated and monitored, risk can be reduced substantially. Leakage of stored CO2 from a storage formation may take place due a loss in the structural integrity of the cap rock. This integrity is controlled by two mechanisms, which are geological leakage mechanism and wellbore leakage mechanism. Wellbores provide access to a reservoir and may serve as preferential flow paths by allowing upward migration of injected CO2. This migration, unlike the lateral movement of the CO2 plume in the reservoir, might occur in a very short time frame, on the order of years to tens of years and, in some critical cases, less. This can have potential adverse effects in relation to safety and/or environmental damage, thus posing a risk to the success of CO2 underground disposal.  

For CO2 storage, the ultimate goal for well-leakage models is to serve as inputs for a certification framework and risk analysis. In order to achieve this goal, there is a need to further investigate a more realistic representation of wellbore element bulk permeability that can differ from element to element within a wellbore system. Researchers have adopted the concept of wellbore lifecycle and recognized its importance in understanding wellbore behavior under different states. However, all of these efforts are scattered and dispersed due to either the various approaches of the study and the multi-disciplinary nature of the problem. In addition, direct measurements of wellbore bulk permeability along well segments are limited and very expensive to obtain. As a result, there is a need to develop a unified method and a conceptual model, which can be used as a practical engineering platform to assess wellbore integrity. 

A methodology to assess the transport properties of wells is introduced.  The methodology presented systematically identifies and estimates the effect of each of the physical and chemical processes responsible for the alteration of the transport properties of wells. Based on the physics involved in these permeability alteration processes, a four-group classification is proposed: geomechanical damage, hydrochemical damage, mud removal, and deterioration damage (cement). These processes can occur during the various phases of a well’s life, namely drilling, completion, production, and abandonment.

Example of wellbore bulk permeability calculation for a typical 54 –year old vertical well, drilled in the Weyburn oil field in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, using the proposed methodology is presented. Estimate of permeability is in good agreement with direct measurements conducted as a component of the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Estuarine-associated facies make up a significant component of ancient geological systems, and are exceedingly economically important today for their ability to trap hydrocarbons. While many aspects of estuaries are understood today, little is documented regarding the sedimentological and ichnological character of middle and
inner estuary channel-fill deposits. These deposits are associated with deposition in entrenched, almost fully marine tidal channels, and are deposited across the width of the channel as a combination of inclined heterolithic and heterolithic strata.
Willapa Bay provides an excellent locale to compare ancient channel-fill deposits present in Pliocene to Pleistocene-aged terrace deposits to modern examples from tidal
channels. Sedimentological and ichnological criteria for these channel-fills will be discussed, as will vertical profiles, lateral trends, and the depositional affinity and
character of these channel-fills. Because channel-fills vary in a transitional and predictable fashion, they act as excellent palaeogeographical indicators when discerning
ancient estuarine environments.</etd_ms:description>

This thesis focuses on the knowledge and perspectives that the Teetł’it Gwich’in of Teetł’it Zheh (Fort McPherson, NWT) bring to Porcupine caribou co-management.  This paper-based thesis has two major aims: first, to explore how the Teetł’it Gwich’in construct knowledge about caribou; and second, to explore Teetł’it Gwich’in rules-in-use with respect to caribou hunting.  A comparison is made between Gwich’in methods of knowledge construction and rules-in-use with those of the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT), and the Porcupine Caribou Management Board (PCMB), with the intent of understanding difficulties in co-management.  The thesis offers the concept of the Gwich’in Knowledge Complex, a knowledge complex created from multiple sources of information about caribou, including scientific information (mainly from the PCMB and the GNWT) as well as Traditional Knowledge.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Inefficient recovery of fracturing water used in multi-stage hydraulic fracturing operations is a growing industrial concern. Non-recovered water can be trapped in the tight rock matrix and/or in the complex fracture network. Trapped water can block the gas flow and damage the reservoir.

This study reports results of various drainage experiments conducted to identify the factors controlling water displacement in propped hydraulic fractures. We conduct two sets of drainage experiments. First set of experiments are conducted by using a proppant packed column which is saturated with frac-fluid. These experiments are used to investigate the role of proppant and fluid characteristics on fluid recovery. Second set of drainage experiments are conducted in a physical fracture model.  These experiments are designed to investigate the role of gravity, drawdown, surface tension and proppant wettability on fluid recovery.

The results of this study suggest that gravity plays a dominant role in fracture cleanup and that water cleanup in fractures below well may be inefficient. Increasing the drawdown does not improve water recovery. Reducing surface tension and using treated hydrophobic proppant improves the sweep efficiency and in turn the load recovery.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This interdisciplinary dissertation explores the &lt;i&gt;World of Art&lt;/i&gt; (Mir Iskusstva&lt;/i&gt;, 1899-1904), &lt;i&gt;The Golden Fleece&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Zolotoe runo&lt;/i&gt;, 1906-1909) and &lt;i&gt;Apollo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Apollon&lt;/i&gt;, 1909-1917), three art periodicals that became symbols of the print revival and Europeanization in late Imperial Russia. Preoccupied with high quality art reproduction and graphic design, these journals were conceived and executed as art objects and examples of fine book craftsmanship, concerned with the physical form and appearance of the periodical as such. Their publication advanced Russian book art and stimulated the development of graphic design, giving it a status comparable to that of painting or sculpture. This work offers a detailed examination of the first or “inaugural” numbers, which represented manifesto-like editorial positions expressed in words and images. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;World of Art&lt;/i&gt; announced the Europeanization of art theories and art themes and offered a Russian version of Art Nouveau; &lt;i&gt;The Golden Fleece&lt;/i&gt; promoted Symbolist art, while &lt;i&gt;Apollo&lt;/i&gt; advocated Apollonianism as a “classical revival”. In exploring journals as art objects, this dissertation engages Gérard Genette’s notion of “paratext”, which serves as an umbrella approach to the explanation of the material dimension of the periodical. Treated as spatio-temporal media combinations, the art periodicals are analyzed as complex artefacts that combine text and image, which together affect meaning. This dissertation also explores in detail the historical preconditions of the rise of art journals, i.e. the emergence of the first art periodicals and illustrated press in the nineteenth century, the development of reproduction technologies and the role of art reproductions in culture – all of which are factors that led to the appearance of the journals as art objects. Further, it analyses the socio-historical context of the formation and function of editorial boards and examines the periodicals’ ideologies as articulations of “group identities” that became the impetus behind the art journals’ visual appearance.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is critical to treatment success. Using an epidemiological and community-based participatory research approach, my thesis reports on two papers related to antiretroviral therapy success (and subsequent failure). My thesis also includes a third paper which discusses an effective and appropriate knowledge translation plan. In the first paper, I used logistic regression to compare initial treatment success among treatment-naïve HIV-positive individuals cared for at the Northern Alberta HIV Program. For individuals achieving initial treatment success, I used survival analysis to determine the probability of subsequent treatment failure. Results showed that compared to Canadian-born, non-Aboriginal patients, the odds of achieving initial treatment success were similar for foreign-born patients and significantly lower for Canadian-born Aboriginal patients. Of those individuals who achieved initial treatment success, compared to Canadian-born, non-Aboriginal patients, foreign-born and Canadian-born Aboriginal patients had similar rates of treatment failure. I concluded that HIV clinicians, researchers, HIV community services organizations, and HIV-positive individuals, work together to better understand adherence to antiretroviral therapy. As such, my second study used focused ethnography to understand, from the perspective of HIV-positive individuals who maintain adherence to their antiretroviral therapy, reasons for antiretroviral therapy success. I conducted one-on-one interviews with 14 individuals with “chaotic” lives (e.g., unstable housing, substance use, involvement in the sex trade, and incarceration) but who nonetheless had demonstrated sustained adherence to antiretroviral therapy and involved a ‘grand tour question’; “what is your secret for taking your HIV medication all the time?”. My data revealed “control” as the cornerstone for maintaining adherence. Participants felt that while they had little or no control over their life circumstances they recognized that, by taking their ART, they could have control over their HIV treatment, which enabled them to make additional positive life changes. The third paper is a commentary describing my knowledge translation plan (a video and peer-educators) to move the knowledge generated from the previous project into action. My evaluation of this knowledge translation plan emphasized the importance of “humanizing” the experience of ART adherence; peer-educators became local HIV medication “celebrities” to their peers. Together, the findings from this thesis consider antiretroviral therapy in a new light by emphasizing success; clinicians must be aware of the extent to which individuals believe they can control their HIV treatment and incorporate support for this sense of control in efforts to improve adherence.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Although pens and paper are pervasive in the analog world, their digital counterparts, styli and tablets, have yet to achieve the same adoption or frequency of use. Digital styli should provide a natural, intuitive method to take notes, annotate, and sketch, but have yet to reach their full potential. There has been surprisingly little research focused on understanding why inking experiences differ so vastly between analog and digital media and amongst various styli themselves. To enrich our knowledge on the stylus experience, this thesis contributes a foundational understanding of the factors implicated in the varied experiences found within the stylus ecosystem today. 

The thesis first reports on an exploratory study utilizing traditional pen and paper and tablets and styli that observed quantitative and behavioural data, in addition to preferential opinions, to understand current inking experiences. The exploration uncovered the significant impact latency, unintended touch, and stylus accuracy have on the user experience, whilst also determining the increasing importance of stylus and device aesthetics and stroke beautification. The observed behavioural adaptations and quantitative measurements dictated the direction of the research presented herein. 

A systematic approach was then taken to gather a deeper understanding of device latency and stylus accuracy. A series of experiments garnered insight into latency and accuracy, examining the underlying elements that result in the lackluster experiences found today. The results underscored the importance of visual feedback, user expectations, and perceptual limitations on user performance and satisfaction. The proposed Latency Perception Model has provided a cohesive understanding of touch- and pen-based latency perception, and a solid foundation upon which future explorations of latency can occur. 

The thesis also presents an in-depth exploration of unintended touch. The data collection and analysis underscored the importance of stylus information and the use of additional data sources for solving unintended touch. The behavioral observations reemphasized the importance of designing devices and interfaces that support natural, fluid interaction and suggested hardware and software advancements necessary in the future. The commentary on the interaction - rejection dichotomy should be of great value to developers of unintended touch solutions along with designers of next-generation interaction techniques and styli.

The thesis then concludes with a commentary on the areas of the stylus ecosystem that would benefit from increased attention and focus in the years to come and future technological advancements that could present interesting challenges in the future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Industrial information systems can improve the management of industrial operations by providing relevant and timely information on the status of physical assets via condition and process monitoring systems, and by enabling the effective use of data by systems and processes that restore proper functionality via control and maintenance systems. A framework and methods have been developed that extend current information system design methods for design and evaluation of effective industrial information systems, as a method for more concretely demonstrating the value of system features prior to system design, and for assessing system performance after implementation for continuous system improvement. An effective system from the framework’s perspective is first, performance-based, i.e. benefits due to the system are balanced with associated costs. Second, it is fit for the system owner’s purpose, i.e. it has been designed with respect to organizational business strategy, objectives, and constraints. And third, it is holistic, i.e. it addresses various performance criteria that are important to the system stakeholders, e.g. operational excellence, financial, safety and environmental. This thesis describes the development and application of the framework and methods, and verifies their effectiveness using data from an industrial operation. The application case is on the development of a machine condition monitoring and maintenance management information system for mobile machine management of mining and production operations. Evaluation methods have been developed to assess several candidate systems and to select the most effective alternative as part of the framework. The first method is a risk assessment method for analytical performance evaluation of the system using a time-based, event-risk tree model. The second method involves simulating the system for evaluating system performance based on a developed probability model linked, stochastic, discrete event simulation method, which includes machine events, operations workflow, information flow, and decision making related to the case operations. After system alternatives are evaluated, the process for selecting the most effective system is then demonstrated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method coupled with the framework as a multi-criteria decision analysis method. Verification of the case description, models, and the assumed parameter values has been achieved by subject matter expert review.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Naïve Theory is one the dominant accounts amongst philosophers of language. This theory has much to offer, however it does not in all cases bode well with intuitions. Two puzzles are raised and investigated here. The first is a puzzle regarding certain simple sentences. The Naïve Theory does not recognize semantic differences amongst simple sentences which are cognitively very different. The second is a puzzle regarding attitude ascriptions. The truth-values the Naïve Theory assigns to an important subset of such ascriptions disagree with the pretheoretical intuitions of ordinary language users. The first and second chapters examine some of the ways that Naïve Theorists have attempted to resolve the puzzle and finds them insufficient. In the first chapter modifications to the Naïve Theory are proposed which aim to preserve the referentialist core of the theory while accommodating intuitions regarding cognitive significance. The second chapter discusses the extension of the Naïve Theory to attitude ascribing sentences, presents the truth-value discrepancy problem and evaluates the pragmatic and psychological-explanatory accounts that have been developed in response. The third chapter examines two standard contextualist accounts of attitude ascriptions that aim to bring referentialist semantics in line with the truth-value assignments of ordinary speakers. It is argued that, while standard versions of contextualism can respect truth-value intuitions to a large extent, these accounts make overly demanding claims about what it is that speakers represent with their reports. The fourth chapter explores a more radical version of contextualism that has been recently developed by Stefano Predelli and John MacFarlane. The account developed there takes the truth-value of attitude ascriptions to be sensitive to the explanatory projects of those who ascribe them. The non-standard version of contextualism advanced takes the word choice in attitude ascriptions to make a semantic difference relative to the explanatory contexts to which the ascriptions are meant to contribute. Employing Kit Fine’s relationist semantics, the semantic difference is cashed out in terms of coordination relations that hold between the ascriptions and the set of statements which comprise the contextually salient explanation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Phagocytosis is an important, evolutionarily conserved mechanism integral to immune defense and homeostasis. Phagocytosis is initiated by the interaction of receptors on the surface of phagocytes with ligands on large particles, generally over 1 μm. Receptor ligation results in actin polymerization, which subsequently leads to particle internalization. The main objective of my thesis research was to characterize functional phagocytic responses at inflammatory sites, where various responses are involved in the clearance of pathogens, dying or senescent cells, and in tissue repair/ wound healing. While this balance is well understood in mammals, much less is known in lower vertebrates.
In accordance with mammals, I found that differentiation along the macrophage pathway resulted in increases in phagocytic capacity, with mature macrophage having the greatest capacity. Interestingly, activation resulted in differential regulation of phagocytosis in monocytes and mature macrophages. Within these subsets there was also differential regulation of phagolysosome fusion and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activation of specific phagocytic responses at distinct stages of differentiation suggests that these responses may allow specialization of host immunity requirements within specialized niches.
When phagocytic responses to inflammatory or homeostatic responses were studied, I found that teleost fish displayed divergent responses following phagocytosis, which is consistent with observations in mice. However, I found significant differences between these species with regards to the level of responsiveness to zymosan and apoptotic bodies, the identity of infiltrating leukocytes, their rate of infiltration, and the kinetics and strength of resulting antimicrobial responses. The primary differences were noted in the neutrophilic responses. Importantly, I found that activated murine, but not teleost, neutrophils possess the capacity to internalize apoptotic cells, resulting in decreased neutrophil ROS production. This may play an important part in the recently identified anti-inflammatory activity that mammalian neutrophils display during the resolution phase of inflammation. 
Goldfish responses were partially regulated by soluble factors. However, no changes were noted in canonical mammalian factors, leading to identification of a novel role for a unique teleost receptor- soluble colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (sCSF-1R). Soluble CSF-1 receptor was originally described as a regulator of macrophage proliferation. Soluble CSF-1R is highly upregulated following interaction with apoptotic cells, resulting in reduced cellular infiltration, phagocytosis, ROS production, expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and downstream antimicrobial responses. The effects sCSF-1R mirrored several of those induced by apoptotic cells, suggesting that sCSF-1R may be a central player in the regulation of anti-inflammatory responses induced by apoptotic cells. 
These observations were then applied to the study of an Aeromonas infection. Aeromonas is a highly virulent fish pathogen with devastating effects on the fish farming industry. It has been previously shown that increases in the production of reactive intermediates by host immune cells cause significant cytotoxicity at the infection site, but have limited protective effects against this catalase-producing bacterium. I found that Aeromonas veronii infection promotes systemic expression of sCSF-1R. However, unlike other pathogen models, sCSF-1R was unable to inhibit inflammation at the A. veronii challenge site and had no impact on the production of ROS in vitro or in vivo. Importantly though, I found that the increased systemic expression of sCSF-1R in A. veronii infected fish appears to decrease proliferative activity among cells in the hematopoietic compartment, which is further coupled to a decrease in CSF-1 expression in kidney hematopoietic tissues. 
Overall, the data presented here places the CSF-1 system and its regulator sCSF-1R at the center of both the induction and regulation of inflammation in teleost fish, with the effects of this system impacting the macrophage-lineage cells as well as the neutrophilic and potentially lymphocytic cells.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis addresses the question of excitation of ULF waves by magnetopause instabilities and oscillations. Given proper spacecraft orientations and near magnetopause encounters, the CLUSTER spacecraft mission is used to resolve the space-time ambiguity inherent in a single spacecraft measurements.


A case study is presented where a driver ULF wave is identified in the solar wind and on open field lines in association with a Field Line Resonance (FLR). This is one of the rare examples where a solar wind source has been unambiguously identified and causally linked with excitation of a FLR at the same frequency. It adds to a database of observations that can be used to determine the statistical relationship between various sources of ULF plasma waves and FLRs. It is also one of the few observations of a driver wave on open field lines by SuperDARN, and encourages further use of SuperDARN in that regard.  


In the second case study, a ULF wave signature at 1.7 mHz is observed just outside the magnetopause using CLUSTER and compared with fluctuations at ionospheric altitudes and on the ground. It is shown that ULF fluctuations at the magnetopause coincide with discrete frequency oscillations in HF radars, magnetometers and spacecraft inside the magnetosphere. The Poynting vector and phase propagation outward from the magnetopause, and the absence of a source in the solar wind, suggest a KHI generated surface mode as a source mechanism. 


A third case study presents a magnetopause oscillation resulting from a direct solar wind driver that transfers energy from the solar wind into FLRs. We observe a quasi-monochromatic 2.5 mHz discrete wave oscillation in IMF By. The dusk signature of the wave shows magnetic field and plasma flow oscillations at the magnetopause at the same discrete frequency. The SuperDARN Saskatoon radar in the pre-dawn sector reveals the footprint of an FLR structure with anti-sunward phase propagation that is linked to the solar wind driven magnetopause oscillation. This is the first work using SuperDARN that relates a solar wind driven magnetopause oscillation with a discrete frequency FLR in the magnetosphere.

The thesis concludes by presenting results from a 2D ideal MHD wave model that is successful in qualitatively reproducing observed structure of FLRs for both KHI-like drivers and solar wind-driven magnetopause oscillations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The effects of broiler breeder dietary energy and protein during rearing and dietary energy level of lay diets on egg composition, offspring performance and carcass yield were evaluated. Pullets were fed a diet containing high ME (2,736 kcal/kg; HEREAR), or low ME (2,528 kcal/kg; LEREAR) combined with either high protein (15.3% CP; HPREAR) or low protein (13.7% CP; LPREAR). During lay birds were fed either a high ME (2,900 kcal/kg; HELAY), or low ME (2,800 kcal/kg; LELAY) diet. For 28 wk old hens, a higher protein intake per unit of hen metabolic BW resulted in higher progeny BW only in the female progeny. Carcass yield of broiler progeny was lower when energy to protein ratio in maternal diet decreased upon transition from rearing to laying diet. For 35 wk old hens, effect on offspring BW was transient, higher maternal nutrient intake (feed, protein, energy) during rearing reduced progeny carcass yield.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The minimum degree spanning tree problem is a widely studied NP-hard variation of the minimum spanning tree problem, and a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem. Most of the work done on the minimum degree spanning tree problem has been on approximation algorithms, and very little work has been done studying graph classes where this problem may be polynomial time solvable. The Hamiltonian path problem has been widely studied on graph classes, and we use classes with polynomial time results for the Hamiltonian path problem as a starting point for graph class results for the minimum degree spanning tree problem. We show the minimum degree spanning tree problem is polynomial time solvable for chain graphs. We then show this problem is polynomial time solvable on bipartite permutation graphs, and that there exist minimum degree spanning trees of these graphs that are caterpillars, and that have other particular structural properties.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Increasingly, human activities for the societal development and quality of life can alter, disrupt or destroy aquatic habitat with varying degrees. The rising awareness and concern regarding such type of human activities on stream and riverine ecosystem have resulted in a movement towards habitat compensation to achieve no net loss in productive capacity of fish habitat. As part of a fish habitat compensation project, this thesis investigated detailed flow characteristics in small northern streams and in rock-ramp type nature-like fishpasses through field, laboratory, and numerical studies. The principal motivation for this study is to advance our understanding of flow characteristics in a rock-ramp fishpass to retrofit small streams for fish habitat connectivity and compensation.

First, the flow characteristics of a headwater stream as a fish migration corridor and the hydraulic characteristics of several headwater streams in the Northwest Territories of Canada were investigated. The analysis of stream hydrological or hydraulic flow characteristics demonstrated that some sections of the study stream for certain durations of the study period appeared to naturally provide suitable habitat for select stages of YOY (young-of-the-year) Arctic grayling, while other sections would require certain modifications and additional outlet flow arrangements. The study of hydraulic characteristics explored the nature of at-a-station hydraulic geometry and flow resistance in an unstudied geographic region of the Northwest Territories of Canada for the future habitat assessment and predictions. 

Next, detailed mean and turbulence flow characteristics generated by a staggered arrangement of boulders in a rock-ramp nature-like fishpass were investigated experimentally. The results showed that this type of fishpass can produce adequate water depth and favorable flow velocity, turbulent intensity, and turbulent kinetic energy for suitable fish passage. Some general correlations were developed for predicting the mean and turbulence flow parameters in a rock-ramp fishpass as a function of normalized discharge and streamwise distance. Moreover, a flow resistance analysis based on basic concepts for wake-interference flow regime in this fishpass has resulted in a general equation for the average velocity. 

Finally, a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver was used to investigate the flow characteristics in a rock-ramp nature-like fishpass under different flow conditions and geometric variables. The model was validated with experimental data and a good agreement was achieved. The findings emanating from this numerical study optimized the design of rock-ramp fishpasses.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in adopting Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) based solutions in a variety of domains including: environmental monitoring, industrial automation, battlefield surveillance, and health monitoring. The main thrust of the thesis is on developing new methodologies that allow for \textbf{(a)} increasing the resource sharing of a given WSN infrastructure, and \textbf{(b)} quantifying and assessing the reliability of a WSN taking random node failures into account. The thesis pursues the first direction by investing two network partitioning problems that aim at computing node disjoint subnetworks where each subnetwork satisfies some key quality of service measures. In the second direction, the thesis analyzes three WSN reliability problems. For these problems, we obtain complexity results,  and algorithms for handling the problems. We conclude with some possible future research problems.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase expressing anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL) is an aggressive type of T/null cell lymphoma that mainly affects children and young adults and represents up to 40% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in children. These lymphomas are characterized by the abnormal chromosomal translocations involving the ALK gene resulting in the aberrant expression of an oncogenic fusion protein with constitutive activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. In up to 80% of ALK+ALCL cases, this fusion protein is nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). NPM-ALK conducts its transforming ability through activation of many molecular mechanisms. Despite the well-known role of NPM-ALK in the pathogenesis of ALK+ALCL as demonstrated by several in vitro and in vivo studies, there is evidence argue that this protein does not act alone in these tumors. Further studies are required to identify additional molecular defects in ALK+ALCL, which could contribute to or potentiate NPM-ALK oncogenicity.
The first objective of this thesis examined the detailed mechanism of interaction between NPM-ALK and the tumor suppressor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1, a protein normally absent in most of ALK+ALCL. Furthermore, the biological importance of this binding was demonstrated.
The second objective examined the aberrant expression of the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transcription factor Sox2 in ALK+ALCL cell lines and tumors. Despite its ubiquitous expression, Sox2 transcription activity was detected only in a small subset of tumor cells. Sox2 was demonstrated to contribute to ALK+ALCL tumorigenesis, and its oncogenic potential correlated with its transcriptional activity.
The third objective examined the over-expression of the Wnt pathway members in ALK+ALCL. The over-expression of disheveled proteins 2 and 3 (Dvl-2 and Dvl-3), was detected in ALK+ALCL cell lines and tumors. I demonstrated that Dvl-2 and Dvl-3 play a significant biological role in ALK+ALCL, and signal through the Wnt non-canonical pathway. Furthermore, cross talk between NPM-ALK and Wnt pathway through Dvl proteins was identified.
Overall, the identification of these novel signaling defects and their mechanisms in ALK+ALCL oncogenesis furthered our current understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and provided a framework for the development of multi-target therapies for these malignancies.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this research was to develop new molecular sieve materials and to examine their applications in 
adsorptive gas separation processes.  Several techniques to modify zeolite molecular sieve materials were developed, including a new pore size control mechanism and novel surface modification procedures.  The new materials derived from these modification techniques were found to be potentially useful in many adsorptive gas separation processes.

A novel mechanism was developed to systematically control the pore size of titanium silicate molecular sieves through halogen substitution of terminal hydroxyl groups.  These halogen containing zorites represent a new class of size-selective adsorbents with readily tailored and highly specific pore sizes.  Anion-controlled titanium silicates were demonstrated to have promise in multiple areas of size-based separation, particularly light hydrocarbon purification and permanent gas separation.  By controlling the type and quantity of the extra-framework cations, titanium silicate molecular sieve adsorbents were modified to separate ethylene and ethane by either the kinetic phenomenon or an equilibrium process.  All of these modification techniques were synergistically integrated to illustrate that multi-functional adsorbents can be designed and prepared for many target separations.  This approach was demonstrated through the separations of CO2/C2H6 and CO2/CH4.  Anion-controlled adsorbents were modified to selectively exclude ethane and methane by the steric effect, while the equilibrium and kinetic properties of the adsorbents were concomitantly adjusted by surface modification.  The concept of gas adsorption and separation through nanometals interaction was introduced.  Surface-supported nanometals, such as nanosilver, formed on titanium silicate ETS-10 were applied as unique adsorbents to separate gas mixtures, such as Ar/O2 and N2/O2.

Continual research and development in new molecular sieve materials will be crucial to the future of the chemical processing industry, and should be viewed as an avenue for the discovery of next-generation adsorptive gas separation technologies.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging is an essential tool for assessing soft tissues. The desire for increased signal-to-noise and improved tissue contrast has spurred development of imaging systems operating at magnetic fields exceeding 3.0 Tesla (T). Unfortunately, traditional imaging methods are of limited utility on these systems. Novel imaging methods are required to exploit the potential of high field systems and enable innovative clinical studies. This thesis presents methodological advances for human brain imaging at 4.7 T. These methods are applied to assess sub-cortical gray matter in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

Safety concerns regarding energy deposition in the patient precludes the use of traditional fast spin echo (FSE) imaging at 4.7 T. Reduced and variable refocusing angles were employed to effectively moderate this energy deposition while maintaining high signal levels; an assortment of time-efficient FSE images are presented. Contrast changes were observed at low angles, but images maintained a clinically
useful appearance.

Heterogeneous transmit fields hinder the measurement of transverse relaxation times. A post-processing technique was developed to model the salient signal behaviour and enable accurate transverse relaxometry. This method is robust to transmit variations observed at 4.7 T and improves multislice imaging efficiency.

Gradient echo sequences can exploit the magnetic susceptibility difference between tissues to enhance contrast, but are corrupted near air/tissue interfaces. A correction method was developed and employed to reliably produce a multitude of quantitative and qualitative image sets.

Using these techniques, transverse relaxation times and susceptibility field shifts were measured in sub-cortical nuclei of relapsing-remitting MS patients. Abnormalities in the globus pallidus and pulvinar nucleus were observed in all quantitative methods; most other regions differed on one or more measures. Correlations with disease duration were not observed, reaffirming that the disease process commences prior to symptom onset.

The methods presented in this thesis enable efficient qualitative and quantitative imaging at high field strength. Unique challenges, notably patient safety and field variability, were overcome via sequence implementation and data processing. These techniques enable visualization and measurement of unique contrast mechanisms, which reveal insight into neurodegenerative diseases, including widespread sub-cortical gray matter damage in MS.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Tungsten carbide-based metal matrix composite coatings are deposited by PTAW (Plasma Transferred Arc Welding) on production critical components in oil sands mining.  Homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement particles is desirable for optimal wear resistance in order to reduce unplanned maintenance shutdowns.  The homogeneity of the coating can be improved by controlling the heat transfer, solidification rate of the process and the volume fraction of carbide.

The degree of settling of the particles in the deposit was quantified using image analysis.  The volume fraction of carbide was the most significant factor in obtaining a homogeneous coating.  Lowering the current made a modest improvement in homogeneity.  Changes made in other operational parameters did not effect significant changes in homogeneity.

Infrared thermography was used to measure the temperature of the surface of the deposit during the welding process.  The emissivity of the materials was required to acquire true temperature readings.  The emissivity of the deposit was measured using laser reflectometry and was found to decrease from 0.8 to 0.2 as the temperature increased from 900°C to 1200°C.  A correction algorithm was applied to calculate the actual temperature of the surface of the deposit.  The corrected temperature did increase as the heat input of the weld increased.

A one dimensional mathematical model of the settling profile and solidification of the coatings was developed.  The model considers convective and radiative heat input from the plasma, the build-up of the deposit, solidification of the deposit and the settling of the WC particles within the deposit.  The model had very good agreement with the experimental results of the homogeneity of the carbide as a function of depth.  This fundamental model was able to accurately predict the particle homogeneity of an MMC deposited by an extremely complicated process.  It was shown that the most important variable leading to a homogeneous coating is to operate at the packing saturation limit of the reinforcement.   In the case of the MMC explored, a fully homogeneous coating was obtained with 50 vol% WC in a NiCrBSi matrix.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of Canada wetlands once utilized for agricultural purposes are being restored to their pre-existing hydrological state. The overall objective of this research was to assess differences in microbial community structure and soil organic matter between native (reference) and restored riparian soils of varying times since restoration. Samples (0-6 cm) were taken from a total of 43 reference and restored wetlands. The soil microbial community was described using phospholipid fatty acid analysis and soil organic matter was characterized by isolating carbon pools using acid hydrolysis and physical separation techniques. Differences between younger restored (1-3 yrs, 4-6 yrs) and reference soils were observed in terms of microbial biomass and composition, and carbon concentration and distribution among pools. Although the carbon distribution in the older restored (7-11 yrs) and reference soils differed, similarities in other measured variables indicated a recovery within this time period.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) have gained attention in both industry and academia
due to their versatile fields of application. One of the main characteristics of a sensor
node is its limited energy supply. The network needs to be reliable in the sense
that it can deliver the data to sink with the presence of multiple link failures. Having
more than one sink provides alternative paths to route packets in the presence
of link failures and helps load balancing. Degree Constrained Shortest Path Trees
(DCSPT) can be used as routing trees to limit the communication of sensor nodes
thus conserving energy. In this thesis, we consider the problem of designing logical
topologies for routing in WSNs with multiple sinks. We design reliable logical
topologies most of which are based on DCSPT in grid and random graphs. We also
design scheduling and routing algorithms for the logical topologies and evaluate the
reliability of the designs using simulation. We demonstrate that with moderate link
failures our schemes can reliably transfer data with low delay and the performance
improves as the load of the network decreases.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) is a parent-assisted social skills intervention for teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of this study was to examine whether the PEERS program can be effectively implemented with fidelity in a community setting and achieve positive results for teenagers. Seven teens and their parents participated in the study. Results revealed that overall teens made significant improvement with their social skills that were similar to the findings of the program developers (Laugeson et al., 2009). Social anxiety and autistic symptomatology decreased and durability of treatment was upheld at three month follow-up. According to instructor records of program delivery and evaluations of program instructional quality, the PEERS program was implemented as intended with high quality instruction. These findings support and extend recent research on the positive impacts of the PEERS program and provide evidence of effectiveness in community settings.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This qualitative case study develops our understanding about the micro-processes of change. Categories are socio-cognitive constructs that group similar things and concepts. We use and interpret categories to understand identity and the relationships between items and concepts. Categories help us understand both change and stability in fields. Change occurs when categories die out, are constructed, re-worked or interpreted in different ways. This research suggests that categories are experienced and performed in everyday work and passed on to others through our interactions. The analysis also highlights that we can gain new insights by examining bottom-up change at the micro-level. 
Through examining western medical acupuncture (WMA) and Traditional Chinese Medicine medical acupuncture (TCM-MA) in western health care, this dissertation sheds light on how professionals sustain competing categories by performing and experiencing them in different ways. The mixed-methods analysis of interviews, journal articles and textbooks revealed seven micro-processes that best explain the sustaining of competing categories: 1. Describing medical acupuncture with different meaning systems, 2. Learning and teaching different approaches, 3. Conducting research in different ways, 4. Altering work processes, rationale and content, 5. Deepening relationships with clients, 6. Viewing their professional identity (dis)similarly and 7. (Re)Drawing the boundary between personal and professional identity. Together, these micro-processes highlight the different ways that different groups of professionals perform and experience competing categories by: (re)assembling meaning systems, performing techniques and practices and (re)conceptualizing identity. 
It is implicit in the categories literature that the existence of competing categories is a temporary state and that one category will become dominant. In contrast to the literature, my dissertation research found that competing categories are sustained by different groups who perform and experience their category in different ways. This research contributes to the growing literature about categories and the micro-processes of change.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Many robotic systems are required to operate in unstructured environments. This imposes significant challenges on algorithm design. Particularly, motion control and planning algorithms should be robust to noise and outliers, because uncertainties are inevitable. In addition, independence from scene model and calibration parameters is preferred; otherwise, the tedious model extraction and calibration procedures need to be redone with every change in the environment. The basic problem that this dissertation addresses is how to robustly control the motion of a vision-based manipulator and plan occlusion-free paths in unstructured environments. Vision-based motion control without using calibration or a geometric model is studied in Uncalibrated Visual Servoing (UVS). In this dissertation, we adopt a framework based on UVS and contribute to two distinct areas: robust visual servoing and robust randomized path planning. We develop a statistically robust algorithm for UVS, which detects outliers and finds robust estimates of the uncalibrated visual-motor Jacobian, a central matrix in the visual servoing control law. We integrate the robust Jacobian estimation into a real-time feedback control loop and present case studies. To avoid the visual and joint-limit constraints, we propose a robust sampling-based path planning algorithm. The proposed planner fits well within the UVS framework and facilitates occlusion-free paths, despite not knowing the obstacle model. Finally, our third and last contribution is a novel UVS approach based on extracting the geometry of three images in the form of the trifocal tensor. We experimentally validate this approach and show that the proposed UVS controller handles some of the most challenging degenerate configurations of image-based visual servoing.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Over the years, how to reduce the operational cost, raise the profit and enhance the operational safety attracts tremendous interests in the chemical and petroleum industry. Since the regulatory control strategy may not achieve such rigorous requirements, higher level process control activities, such as production planning, real time optimization (RTO) and multi-variable control are more frequently taken into account. 
Even the classical optimization based techniques, such as model predictive control (MPC), have seen considerable successes in many practical applications. However, they are still suffering from computational issues in the circumstances of a large-scale plant, complex dynamic system or the short sampling time period. Furthermore, these traditional optimization techniques usually employ the deterministic formulations, but often become unsuitable for uncertain dynamics. Hence, this thesis
is mainly concerned with developing computationally effective algorithms to solve practical problems arising from those high level process control activities and highly
affected by the disturbances.

Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is one of the most efficient computational frameworks to handle large-scale, stochastic dynamic optimization problems. However, several critical issues, including risk management, continuous state space representation and the stability of the control policy, prohibit its application in process control. To overcome these shortcomings,
1. We developed a systematic approach to extract the probabilistic model from the operational data of a plant-wide system and proposed a risk-sensitive RTO
approach based on ADP.
2. An innovative procedure for designing control Lyapunov function (CLF) and robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF) is presented for a nonlinear control affine system under the input and state constraints.
3. Based on the well-designed RCLF, a mixed control strategy, combining the advantages of MPC and ADP, is proposed to handle the stability issue of the
ADP control scheme.

In addition to dynamic optimization, another focus of this research is the discrete optimization. Considering mixed integer linear programming (MILP) becomes increasingly common in the planning and scheduling of the chemical production, it is worthwhile to explore a more efficient algorithm for solving this NP hard problem. A modified Benders decomposition approach, featured by its tighter cutting plane, is presented to accelerate the solution procedure.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Electrons, the fundamental charge carriers in solid-state devices, possess three intrinsic
properties: mass, charge and spin. Spin is a quantum mechanical property, but can be loosely
visualized as a tiny “intrinsic” magnetic dipole moment attached to an electron. In conventional
electron devices, spin magnetic moments point along random directions in space and play no
significant role in device operation. In the emerging field of “spintronics” the central theme is to
harness the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers to realize novel data storage and
information processing technologies. Spintronic devices are already ubiquitous in state-of-the-art
hard disks with large storage densities. A concerted global effort is underway to explore various
spin-based information processing concepts, which can potentially be more energy-efficient than
traditional charge-based electronics.
In recent years, substantial research has been devoted to understanding carrier spin dynamics in
metallic multilayers, tunnel junctions and inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, germanium
and various III-V compounds. On the other hand, π-conjugated organic semiconductors that play
a crucial role in organic electronics and displays are relatively new materials in the area of
spintronics. Organic semiconductors offer several advantages (such as mechanical flexibility,
chemical tunability of physical properties, low-cost and low-temperature processing) compared
to their inorganic counterparts. The ability to control carrier spin dynamics in organic materials
will open up possibility of new devices such as flexible non-volatile memories, spin-based
organic light emitting diodes and spin filters.

In this work, we have explored two key spin related phenomena in organic semiconductor
nanostructures: (a) spin-polarized transport and (b) spin filtering. In the first sub-project, we
explore spin transport in “nanowire” geometry instead of commonly studied thin film devices.
Such experiments shed light on the spin relaxation mechanisms in organics and indicate ways to
minimize such effects. Fabrication of organic nanowires with well-controlled geometry in the
sub-100 nm range is a non-trivial task, and in this subproject we have developed a novel
technique for this purpose. Spin transport in rubrene nanowires has been studied, which indicates
significant suppression of spin relaxation in nanowire geometry compared to rubrene thin films.
Our experimental data indicates that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant spin relaxation
mechanism in rubrene nanowires. In the second sub-project, we explore spin filtering
(transmission of one particular type of spin) through an organic nanostructure in which single
wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are wrapped with single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules.
Efficient spin filtering has been observed in this system, which may enable magnetless spintronic
devices in the future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Intercropping systems offer potential benefits relative to monocultures of increased crop yields and improved pest control through physical, chemical, or behavioural interference and the enhancement of natural enemy populations, prompting increased predation and parasitism.  Intercrops of canola (Brassica napus L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in various proportions were investigated at three sites in Alberta, Canada, in 2005 and 2006, to determine effects on 1) agronomic parameters, including crop grain and biomass yields, crop quality (canola oil and canola and wheat protein), lodging, soil microbial communities, and wheat leaf diseases; 2) pest insects, including flea beetle (Phyllotreta spp.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) damage to seedling canola and root maggot (Delia spp.) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) adult collection numbers, egg populations, and canola taproot damage; and 3) beneficial insects, including ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and the predator-parasitoid Aleochara bilineata Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae).  Crop yields were similar in intercrops and monocultures, and benefits of intercropping were observed in enhanced crop quality characteristics in some site-years.  Neither soil microorganisms nor wheat leaf diseases generally responded to intercropping regimes.  Intercropping did not reduce flea beetle damage to canola seedlings.  Flea beetle damage was greatest at the first true-leaf stage of canola development.  Although a thiamethoxam seed treatment reduced flea beetle herbivory, untreated plots generally did not sustain greater than 20% damage, suggesting that seed treatments were usually unnecessary.  Adult Delia did not respond to intercropping canola with wheat, but egg populations were lower in intercrops on a land area basis.  Canola taproot damage was as much as 13% reduced in intercrops compared to monocultures.  Carabid beetles appeared to respond to qualities of the intercrops and monocultures, such as ground cover, rather than to the level of vegetational diversity itself, but carabid diversity was enhanced in diverse intercrops compared to canola monocultures in one site-year.  Aleochara bilineata adult populations and parasitism rates were favoured in canola monocultures, but a temporal shift in A. bilineata adult collection numbers suggests reduced preference for canola monocultures in early summer.  Benefits of canola-wheat intercrops identified in this study do not appear sufficient to recommend these cropping systems for widespread adoption in western Canada.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Since the invention of the atomic force microscope (AFM), this technology has had profound implications in the study of material science and molecular biology.  The ability to visualize and perform quantitative analysis of the nanoscale properties of surfaces has provided great insights into these nanoscale landscapes.  The present dissertation manuscript exploits this technology for the measurement of charge transport through molecular films and the development of combinatorial force microscopy.  
Firstly, this work probed, for the first time, charge transport through molecular films derived from diazonium salts grafted to carbon electrodes using conductive atomic force microscopy.  We found the charge transport properties of a molecular junction are dependent upon the chemical structure of the molecular film.  We also investigated the effect of molecular film compression and deformation has on charge transport.  In this, we observed increases in current densities associated with increases in applied load to the molecular film.  Furthering these initial findings, PPF/NAB/Cu molecular junctions were fabricated having junction sizes ranging between micro-scale and nanoscale.   The charge transport experiments reveal an agreement of electron transport properties between the metal deposited PPF/NAB/Cu junction and a PPF/NAB/Cu AFM tip junction at an applied load of approximately 60nN.  This form of molecular layer charge transport control may potentially open new horizons for integration of molecular films into the microelectronics industry.  
	This dissertation manuscript also describes the development of the quantitative interrogation opposing chemical libraries involved in combinatorial inverted atomic force microscopy.  Tipless cantilever’s were patterned with chemically modified nanorods.  These modified nanorods were then used as chemical identifiers during a combinatorial force microscopy experiment and for the first time 16 interactions were monitored within one experiment in a continuous medium.  Thus, providing excellent for the validation that combi-AFM is a truly quantitative high-throughput technology.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Because of their ability to infect bacterial cells, bacteriophages or phages (viruses
that infect and kill bacteria) show promise in treating diseases caused by
multidrug resistant bacteria like the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). In order
to carry out their lifecycle, phages must recognize, adsorb to, and inject their
genetic material into the host. Host recognition is a crucial stage during phage
infection and is divided in two main stages: a) reversible binding, characterized by
low affinity binding of the phage to a secondary receptor in the outermost
membrane of the host, and b) irreversible binding, characterized by a high affinity
binding of the phage to its primary receptor. A wide variety of phage receptors
have been characterized including lipopolysaccharide, pili, flagella, porins,
capsules, and ligand-gated porins. Two random plasposon insertion libraries were
screened against a collection of Bcc specific phages. Bacterial mutants resistant to
phage infection were then isolated and the disrupted genes and proteins involved
in phage adherence were characterized.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifies forests that have been grown in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.  It attempts to increase market share for certified paper via a Business Development Plan (BDP).  This thesis provides analysis of the FSCs marketing using a survey and case study approach.  The survey of institutional paper buyers reveals trends that suggest that the market for FSC and other certified papers is gaining popularity with institutional buyers, even though final consumers remain price sensitive.  Components of institutional behavior that might cause an organization to adopt FSC are analyzed. This analysis reveals that adoption is more likely if it is important to an institution’s stakeholders and if reputation can be increased, even given increased costs.  However, much of the growth in market share of FSC remains unexplained by the BDP.  Hence the market for FSC and certified paper may be expanding independent of FSC and BDP.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Current wildfire activity highlights the precarious ecological state of for- ests owing to the combined effects of climate change and management practices. Because the analysis of long-term fire frequency from sedimentary archives is critical to understanding fire dynamics, there is a continuous need to refine meth- odologies used to reconstruct fire frequency and intensity. Visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy offers a rapid and non-destructive method for remotely sensing charcoal concentrations from lacustrine sediment cores. In this study,
a predictive model for quantifying charcoal concentrations from lake sediment absorbance was developed and subsequently applied to an 8000 year sediment record from Grand Teton National Park (Wyoming, USA). This record provides a detailed continuous fire history that captures regional fire trends obtained by optically counted charcoal from nearby lakes. The novel spectroscopic method for charcoal quantification reduces laboratory processing time tremendously and avoids various biases associated with conventional optical microscopic charcoal enumeration techniques.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: VP16 initiates the HSV replication cycle by activating immediate early (IE) gene expression. It recruits the RNA pol II through an acidic C-terminal domain. The defective VP16 encoded by the V422 mutant of HSV-1 possesses a truncated C-terminal domain. Therefore, V422 replication is suppressed in most cell-lines, except U2OS osteosarcoma cells. The permissive phenotype of U2OS cells stems from a failure to express one or more inhibitory factors that are produced in restrictive cells. The initial project was designed to identify these host inhibitory factors in restrictive cells of V422, using siRNA silencing technology. To facilitate the siRNA screen, a GFP reporter gene has been inserted into the thymindine kinase (TK) gene of the V422 genome and the wild-type KOS genome. This thesis provides information about characterizing the kinetics of GFP expression from recombinant viruses at both protein and mRNA levels, during different infection times in HeLa and Vero cells.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Contemporary Oriental dance practitioners that explicitly tie their artworks to the East often validate their involvement by crafting their dances and aesthetic to ever-shifting definitions of authenticity and ethnicity. However, practitioners of the youngest belly dance style have increasingly turned away from the East as a reference point, blending modern electronica and urban dance forms with historically Western aesthetics such as Victorian fashion and vaudeville theatre. Through the use of temporally marked elements of the Occident’s historical fascination with the Orient, Vaudevillian Tribal Fusion performers draw attention to the role of the West in the intercultural evolution of modern belly dance which allows dancers to escape issues of authenticity and cultural appropriation. More than mere aesthetic play, this highlighting of a long history of North American belly dance suggests Tribal Fusion dancers’ own validation strategies in a transnational dance subculture which is fraught with romanticization of the exotic Other.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examines the issues related to calibrating digital cameras and lenses, which is an essential prerequisite for the extraction of precise and reliable 3D metric information from 2D images. The techniques used to calibrate a Canon PowerShot A70 camera with 5.4 mm zoom lens and a professional single lens reflex camera Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II with 35 mm, 85 mm, 135 mm and 200 mm prime lenses are described. The test results have demonstrated that a high correlation exists among some interior and exterior orientation parameters. The correlations are dependent on the parameters being adjusted and the network configuration. Not all of the 11 interior orientation parameters are significant for modelling the camera and lens behaviour. The first two coefficients K1, K2 would be sufficient to describe the radial distortion effect for most digital cameras. Furthermore, the interior orientation parameters of a digital camera and lens from different calibration tests can change. This work has demonstrated that given a functional model that represents physical effects, a reasonably large number of 3D targets that are well distributed in three-dimensional space, and a highly convergent imaging network, all of the usual parameters can be estimated to reasonable values.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Moral virtues need intellectual virtues.  I support this claims by (1) proposing a response in terms of intellectual virtues and other psychological factors to situationalist critiques against moral virtue, (2) arguing that intellectual virtues must assess moral contexts for proper manifestation of moral virtue, and (3) showing that interrelations between moral and intellectual virtues deem them inextricable in moral behavior.  These arguments--(1), (2), and (3), respectively—are designed to show the function, the prescriptive advantage and the descriptive accuracy of intellectual virtues in virtue theory.  Further, I argue that supplementing virtue theory with intellectual virtues yields more subtle characterological assessments of agents in moral action.   Finally, I demonstrate the function of intellectual virtues to fill the theoretical gap revealed by the problem of moral luck.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Braces are commonly used to correct misalignments or malocclusions in the mouth.  One particular orthodontic treatment utilizes archwire rotation to control the anterior inclination of a tooth and motion is achieved through the interaction of a rectangular archwire within the rectangular bracket slot.  The mechanical interaction between the wire and bracket slot can result in both elastic and plastic bracket deformation.  To investigate bracket deformation due to archwire rotation the Orthodontic Torsion Simulator (OTS) was developed at the University of Alberta.  A three dimensional (3D) DIC measurement method will be employed to determine the 3D deformation of the orthodontic brackets.  The 3D DIC method will utilize two CCD cameras coupled with a stereo microscope and deformation of self-ligating orthodontic brackets of varying geometry will be compared using the 3D DIC method to demonstrate the 3D behavior of orthodontic brackets due to archwire rotation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Long before social, cultural and environmental history was accepted by academic circles, Catharine Robb Whyte (1906-1979) of Concord, Massachusetts founded in 1958 the Wa-Che-Yo-Cha-Pa foundation, now known as the Whyte Museum. Pioneering the exploration of human history of the National Parks, Catharine – a trained artist  – led the way for later historians who followed in her footsteps. Since its opening in 1968, the Whyte Museum gives visitors and researchers alike the possibility of immersing themselves into the cultural and natural history of Banff National Park. Although the Archives of the Whyte Museum are looked through by many historians, a detailed historical study of its founder has never been undertaken. Drawing mostly on Catharine’s personal writings and correspondence, we will study the contributions of this woman to the preservation of heritage in the Rocky Mountains.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Diabetes is a growing public health issue in Canada, and this concern is now extending to children and adolescents.  Our goal was to conduct research projects aimed at pediatric diabetes surveillance in Alberta, Canada.  To identify diabetes cases, we applied the National Diabetes Surveillance System (NDSS) case definition to retrospectively-collected, population-based datasets.  

Our first objective was to assess the regional variation in diabetes incidence and prevalence across urban and rural areas between 1995-2007.  After observing an unexpected decrease in diabetes incidence between 2002-2006, our second objective was to investigate a possible association with changes in physician remuneration through Alternate Relationship Plans (ARPs) that may have affected the number of diabetes cases identified from administrative data.

Our results indicated that there was no regional variation in diabetes incidence and prevalence over the period of study and that there was no association between ARPs and the observed decline in incident diabetes cases.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Mixing Height (MH), Convective Condensation Level (CCL), and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) are computed with different methods and we examined whether these parameters can help to discriminate between weak and strong convection.  The observational data set contains soundings released from Stony Plain in Alberta and The Pas in Manitoba for the summers of 2006 and 2007.  The major findings were:  
1) The Mixing Height values computed with the Heffter method were reliable provided the critical inversion criterion was adjusted for Prairie conditions.
2) The Mixing Height values computed with the Moist Mixed layer method were in good agreement with Mixing Heights computed with the Heffter method.
3) The Mixing Height values computed with the Holzworth parcel method were less useful in that often the potential temperature did not decrease with height above the ground.
4) Observed convective cloud base heights tended to be lower than the CCL computed using the surface parcel method, the 50 mb mixed parcel method, and the moist mixed parcel method.
5) The MH, the sounding-based CCL, and the CAPE did not differentiate between weak and strong convection.
6) We derived a new parameter: the difference between the convective cloud base and the Moist Air Mixing Height.  This parameter did discriminate between the likely occurrence of strong and weak convection.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is used as a chemical additive to enhance bitumen recovery from oil sands by surface-mining extraction process. The addition of NaOH adjusts the pH of the slurry water to pH ~8.5 (approximate pH of process water). The change in pH of oil sand slurry affects the process performance. In the current study, the effect of pH was investigated by varying the caustic usage up to about 0.7 wt. % (based on the mass of oil sand). Many parameters such as: Naphthenic acid, divalent cations and the surface charges of particles, bitumen and air bubbles have a significant impact on bitumen recovery and froth quality. A Study of the extraction process at a fundamental level improves our understanding of the key parameters that govern bitumen recovery. 
Four oil sand ores of different composition were studied. Two ores were classified as high fines (CN912 and AS), and two as average fines (MA and AZ). Using Denver cell flotation, the recovery of high fines ores was observed to be caustic dependent, in contrast to little variation in bitumen recovery with increasing pH for average fines ores. Unlike recovery, the froth quality showed a general improvement with increasing pH for all the ores tested. Such behavior is believed to be related to the fundamental steps of bitumen extraction process such as: air-bitumen attachment (induction) time and slime coating defined as the coating of bitumen droplets by ultrafine particles. The induction time is shown to increase almost linearly with increasing pH for all the ores, while slime coating is shown to be most severe at low pH, improving with increasing pH. The severity of slime coating is shown to be somewhat dependent on the type of ores.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Objective:  To examine sex-specific differences in the demographics and work patterns of Canadian orthodontists.  

Methods:  Questionnaires were mailed/E-mailed to a random sample of 384 orthodontists (189 male, 95 female).  Questions regarding work patterns and personal demographics were created and sex-specific comparisons were conducted. 

Results: The response rate was 53.9%. The demographics and work patterns for male and female orthodontists were similar for most variables. Females were found to be younger; anticipating earlier retirement; and more likely to take a leave of absence. When analyzing the effects of the sex, age, and number of children, age significant affected the number of hours worked per week and number of phase II starts per year. Having children did not significantly affect any variables analyzed.  

Conclusions: As female orthodontists were not found to practice substantially different from males, it is not possible to speculate that the increasing number of women specializing in orthodontics would provoke change in the profession.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis is concerned with the effect of mechanical wear on superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS). This work, for the first time, systematically details the simultaneous surface topography and wetting behavior changes upon abrasion of SHS. The process of physical abrasion was also simulated on the artificial terrains. An intrinsically hydrophobic polymer (PTFE) was plasma etched to fabricate SHS, as wear would solely change surface topography and avoid chemical complications. Wetting behavior was monitored using advancing and receding contact angles (CA). Confocal scanning microscopy (CSM) was used to monitor topography quantitatively using surface topographical descriptors. 
In initial stages of wear receding and advancing CA, remained largely unchanged. Excessive wear resulted in a large increase in CA hysteresis and lowering of the advancing CA. Wetting behavior was correlated with topographical descriptors. Trends in RMS roughness, Skewness and Kurtosis can act as guiding factors towards predicting CA hysteresis on the surface. Main finding was that the physical abrasion can be simulated computationally on analogous artificial terrains.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Improved numerical reservoir models are constructed when all available diverse data sources are accounted for to the maximum extent possible.  Integrating various diverse data is not a simple problem because data show different precision and relevance to the primary variables being modeled, nonlinear relations and different qualities.  Previous approaches rely on a strong Gaussian assumption or the combination of the source-specific probabilities that are individually calibrated from each data source.
	This dissertation develops different approaches to integrate diverse earth science data.  First approach is based on combining probability.  Each of diverse data is calibrated to generate individual conditional probabilities, and they are combined by a combination model. Some existing models are reviewed and a combination model is proposed with a new weighting scheme.  Weakness of the probability combination schemes (PCS) is addressed.  Alternative to the PCS, this dissertation develops a multivariate analysis technique.  The method models the multivariate distributions without a parametric distribution assumption and without ad-hoc probability combination procedures.  The method accounts for nonlinear features and different types of the data.  Once the multivariate distribution is modeled, the marginal distribution constraints are evaluated.  A sequential iteration algorithm is proposed for the evaluation.  The algorithm compares the extracted marginal distributions from the modeled multivariate distribution with the known marginal distributions and corrects the multivariate distribution.  Ultimately, the corrected distribution satisfies all axioms of probability distribution functions as well as the complex features among the given data.
	The methodology is applied to several applications including: (1) integration of continuous data for a categorical attribute modeling, (2) integration of continuous and a discrete geologic map for categorical attribute modeling, (3) integration of continuous data for a continuous attribute modeling.  Results are evaluated based on the defined criteria such as the fairness of the estimated probability or probability distribution and reasonable reproduction of input statistics.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In their highly influential work on the labour market impact of unions termed the collective voice/institutional response model (CVIR), Freeman &amp; Medoff (1984) proposed that whether the union’s monopoly or voice face would prevail greatly depended on the union’s and management’s willingness to compete or cooperate, respectively. However, these authors and the researchers that tested their ideas afterwards neither theorized about nor tested this key moderating condition of a union’s impact. The result has been a confusing, mixed and generally inconclusive litany of research findings about the impact of unions at both the individual and organizational levels of analysis. I attempt to resolve this gap in CVIR by using the appropriateness framework (March 1994) to identify when and under what conditions management and unions, along with their members, will respond cooperatively or competitively toward each other. My empirical results are consistent with the idea that management response is a key moderating mechanism of a union’s power and thus impact, contributing to zero or negative sum outcomes when management chooses to compete (i.e., union power is exerted in the direction of harmful monopoly effects) and positive sum outcomes when management chooses cooperation (i.e., union power is exerted in the direction of beneficial voice effects).  In particular, when environmental cues lead the union and/or unionized employees to believe that management values voice, they will consider “cooperation” an appropriate response under the circumstances and reciprocate in-kind with other-regarding behaviors. On the other hand, when environmental cues lead the union or unionized employees to believe that management may potentially behave opportunistically, they will consider “competition” appropriate under the circumstances, and respond in-kind with self-serving, competitive behaviours. Drawing upon the resource-based view of the firm, I argue how a cooperative union-management relationship can be a source of sustainable competitive advantage for the organization (Barney, 1991).</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis considers PVol (Percentage of Volume) strategies, which are an often used type of algorithmic trading strategies. In a PVol strategy, the broker aims to bring the order execution speed in line with a  percentage of the market volume. This target percentage and the total order size are typically given by the client. In a discrete-time setting, we analyze the optimization problem of minimizing the expected deviations between the realized portion of trading and the target percentage. Under different assumptions, we either solve the problem explicitly or implement a numerical solution in MATLAB.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Since its reorganization in the early 1990s, the English School of international relations has emerged as a popular theoretical lens through which to examine global events.  Those that use the international society approach promote it as a middle-way of theorizing due to its supposed ability to incorporate features from both systemic and domestic perspectives.  A noticeable trend in the School since the end of the Cold War has been its interest with domestic and critical theory concerns, often focusing on individual, discursive or emancipatory issues.  As a result, the English School has been able to accommodate the growing trends in international theory more generally, with the decline of problem-solving theory and the rise of critical projects.  While the School and its practitioners may, for the most part, see value in discussing how domestic or critical variables impact the society of states, such examinations tend to neglect or overlook the systemic level of analysis.  This project takes exception to the decline of the English School’s problem-solving foundations and argues that the School must place more emphasis on the systemic level of analysis if it hopes to be relevant in international theory debates.  To this end, the criticisms of American scholars regarding the School’s lack of methodological rigour and explanatory power are addressed by demonstrating the added value to the international society approach if the constraints of the international system are included in theoretical explanations.  In order to demonstrate how the systemic level alters English School analyses, two areas of popular examination within the School are explored, namely the role of international institutions and the debate over humanitarian intervention.  Ultimately, the contention of this work is that English School scholars can greatly benefit from including systems-level thinking because of what it adds to the School’s explanatory power and also its ability to provide methodological rigour.  In doing so, it is more likely the English School can penetrate the mainstream of international theory in the future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Blood flow to the brain may be disrupted by either a stroke (such as focal ischemia or hemorrhage) or cardiac arrest, where the whole brain becomes ischemic. Both forms of injury result in irreversible neuronal loss leading to neurological impairments and a decrease in the quality of life. Neuroprotective treatments are aimed at minimizing the damage that occurs after brain ischemia, and one of the most successful neuroprotectants developed so far is therapeutic hypothermia. Prolonged cooling has been shown to prevent CA1 neuronal death in animal models of global ischemia and the treatment also improves survival and neurological function in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. In contrast to the well know neuroprotective properties of hypothermia, the effect of this treatment on post-ischemic plasticity and reorganization has not been clearly investigated. This is an important issue, as plastic changes in remaining brain circuits facilitate functional improvement and recovery after ischemia. The current thesis evaluated the influence of hypothermia on several forms of post-ischemic plasticity including neurogenesis and growth factor expression in the hippocampus. A rat model of global ischemia was used to induce degeneration of hippocampal CA1 neurons, and hypothermia was applied either systemically (whole body cooling) or through unilateral brain cooling. We found that the treatment did not negatively impact post-ischemic plasticity on any of our measures even when cooling was maintained for up to 7 days. These results suggest that prolonged cooling may be a safe treatment, however additional models of ischemia should be used to assess this in future studies.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The glass sponge reefs of western Canada are modern analogues to ancient reefs and are unique habitats requiring conservation.  However, the patterns and processes of the glass sponges have not been empirically studied.  Here, I characterized the biology of the glass sponges in their reefs.
I examined the community structure of the sponges at 3 reefs in the Strait of Georgia (SOG), their role in silica cycling, and the stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) of the reef forming sponge Aphrocallistes vastus.  Sponges are spatially structured in patches which localize the abundance of other animals.  Long term dissolution of spicules is negligible and thus a reef can be considered a silica sink.  Lastly, isotope compositions can differentiate populations of A. vastus and depleted carbon signatures at 2 reefs suggest a terrestrial component in their diet.  
My work represents the biological baseline of 3 glass sponge reefs in the SOG.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Alberta oil sands contain one of the world’s largest reserves of oil - over 169 billion barrels of bitumen are economically recoverable with current extraction technologies.  Surface mining, whereby the ore is extricated from the earth and bitumen is obtained via a hot water extraction process, accounts for approximately half of current production of synthetic crude oil and generates about nine cubic meters of raw tailings per cubic meter of oil.  Oil sands facilities are required to operate under a policy of zero water discharge, resulting in impoundments containing more than one billion cubic meters of tailings, a mixture of sand, fines and process-affected water.  Effective treatment processes are required in the immanent future, especially for a class of compounds called naphthenic acids, identified as the primary source of acute toxicity of process-affected water. Aerobic biodegradation of oil sands naphthenic acids by indigenous microbial populations present in tailings ponds has been shown to be slow and incomplete, relative to biodegradation of petroleum-refined naphthenic acids available commercially.  This research focused on treating oil sands process-affected waters by coupling oxidation, as a means of reducing the recalcitrance of naphthenic acids and other organic compounds, with biodegradation to remove organic matter, including the resulting daughter products of oxidation.  In addition, microbial cultures, obtained from an oil sands tailings pond and enriched on organic matter that included naphthenic acids, were assessed for their capability to biodegrade naphthenic acid compounds.  Ozone pretreatment significantly improved the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon in aged process-affected water samples, from 5 mg/L removal in untreated samples to 11-13 mg/L removal in ozone-treated samples.  Ozone exposed indigenous microbial communities were able to degrade an amount of ozone treated organic matter equivalent to those communities not previously exposed, although community structure analysis with microbiological molecular methods indicated these communities were only 65% similar.  Ozone pretreatment of model naphthenic acid compounds enabled a bacterial isolate from an oil sands tailings pond, Acidovorax sp., to remove 40% of the tricyclic naphthenic acid, adamantane-1-carboxylic acid, hypothesized to be cometabolized during biodegradation of more labile ozone by-products.  A fungal isolate from an oil sands tailings pond, Trichoderma harzianum, was capable of degrading two tricyclic model naphthenic acid compounds.  Ozonation coupled with biodegradation is a promising treatment technology for oil sands process-affected waters, as the need for treatment of organic matter more aggressive than natural attenuation has been established.  Ozone pretreatment prior to placement of process-affected waters in reclamation environments, such as end-pit lakes or constructed wetlands, may result in adequate removal of organic matter and the associated toxicity by subsequent biodegradation, without the need for building costly ex-situ wastewater treatment facilities.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Small-talk, flattery, teasing, ridicule, threats or insults are part of the daily fabric of consumers’ life. This dissertation is concerned with the way consumers behave toward others depending on how they are treated themselves. ‘Pay-it-forward’ is the notion that a person who is treated well by someone should be nice toward others (and conversely, a person who is treated badly may treat other people badly in turn). The present research proposes and shows that the pay-it-forward mechanism does not always occur; in fact, under certain circumstances consumers behave in a manner that contradicts it. 
Although research has begun to explore social influences on consumer behavior, to date a coherent theoretical account of how social treatment (i.e., the way a person acts toward another individual during a social encounter) influences consumers is lacking. This thesis offers a theoretical framework for the impact of social treatments, and tests it in four scenario-based experiments and two field studies. Results provide support for the proposed conceptual model, indicating that two dimensions of social treatment (affiliation: friendliness vs. hostility; and relevance for self-assessment: high vs. low) interactively influence consumers’ likelihood to engage in socially-elevating behaviors (i.e. helping another consumer, picking up the tab when dining out with others, returning money to a salesperson who accidentally gives them too much change back for a purchase). Process evidence for the underlying roles of positive/negative affect and perceived social efficacy is provided. The dissertation addresses the implications of these findings to existing theory, and identifies avenues for future research.</etd_ms:description>

H2 is commercially produced using steam CH4 reforming, which is energy and CO2 intensive. Solar molten metal CH4 cracking is an alternative zero emissions technology. Solar radiation is focused with large curved mirrors onto the molten metal. The molten media provides improved heat transfer, a thermal storage medium against transient solar flux, and a unique method of separating H2 and C. Blank and molten metal alumina tube reactors are studied from 1023 K to 1323 K. Plug flow, perfectly mixed, and combined perfectly mixed with a bypass (CPMR) reactor models were numerically implemented to simulate the blank reactor and determine the kinetic parameters. The CPMR model incorporated a third parameter that dictates how much how travels through the bypass. Results for the CPMR model showed k0 = 5.43e15 1/s, Ea = 420.7 kJ/mol and β = 0.426. The CPMR model was shown to have 8.3% ± 6.8% average error against data found in literature. Sn was selected as the bath material for the molten metal reactor (MMR), and the reaction gas was bubbled through the bath using an injector. 18.9% conversion was obtained at 1273 K, and near zero conversion for lower temperatures. A numerical model of the MMR was implemented using a spherical bubble model coupled with the CPMR model for the blank space above the molten metal. The MMR model showed that the majority of CH4 conversion occurred in the blank space above the bath. Decreasing bubble size and increasing bath height improved bubble conversion.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The demand for accurate bitumen-pentane mass transfer data was the main motivation behind this research.  Difficulties such as complex phase behavior, high viscosity and opacity of the hydrocarbon invariably lead to failure of conventional techniques to measure mass transfer coefficients involving heavy oils.  To address this issue, X-ray transmission tomography has been employed for such measurements.  The initial set of experiments in this study measured the free mutual diffusion coefficient of pentane-Athabasca/bitumen, as well as pentane-atmospheric residue.  In addition, forced mass transfer between pentane and both bitumen and atmospheric residue was studied. Forced mass transfer between pentane and these two heavy oils followed a similar pattern when normalized and the pattern is consistent with prevailing understanding. However, mass transfer rates between pentane and Athabasca atmospheric residue are one order of magnitude smaller than for the corresponding bitumen case.   Impacts on the effectiveness of proposed production and refining processes are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Purpose: The main objective of this study was to compare the masticatory and cervical muscle tenderness and general pain sensitivity between patients with TMD and healthy controls.
Methods: Eligible patients completed the Neck Disability Index and Jaw Dysfunction Index. Tenderness of the masticatory and cervical muscles and general pain sensitivity in the hypothenar region of the left hand were measured using an algometer. 
Results: The PPTs of the masticatory as well as cervical muscles of subjects with TMD were significantly lower statistically at almost all sites tested when compared with the healthy controls. Effect sizes were moderate to high indicating a clinically relevant difference between groups. General pain sensitivity of patients with TMD was significantly higher than the healthy control group. The correlation between jaw disability and neck disability was significantly high. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a relationship between neck muscle tenderness and TMD. These findings emphasize the importance of including the neck when evaluating and treating patients with TMD.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study analyses the characteristics and life trajectories of highly educated18 to 35 year old Malawians, how they negotiate their identities in the face of HIV/AIDS, and their opinions regarding the effectiveness of current HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts.  These Malawians are among the privileged few who get an opportunity to complete their secondary education and potentially attend post-secondary classes.  However, their livelihoods are inevitably tied to HIV/AIDS and public health employment opportunities and discourses due to the high HIV/AIDS prevalence in Malawi.  These Malawians routinely presented their identities in the context of their understanding of HIV/AIDS.  They also critically discussed the merits of current HIV/AIDS policies and potential alternative methods to decrease the spread of HIV in Malawi.  By considering who highly educated Malawians are and why they discuss HIV/AIDS in such a manner, more culturally appropriate and innovative solutions in ridding Malawi of this epidemic may be understood.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Radiotherapy is often used to treat prostate cancer. While using high dose of radiation does kill cancer cells, it can cause toxicity in healthy tissues for some patients. It would be best to apply this treatment only to patients who are likely to be immune from such toxicity. This requires a classifier that can predict, before treatment, which patients are likely to exhibit severe toxicity. Here, we explore ways to use certain genetic features, called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), for this task.

This thesis uses several machine learning methods for learning such classifiers for predicting toxicity. This problem is challenging as there are a large number of features (164,273 SNPs) but only 82 samples. We explore an ensemble classification method for this problem, called Mixture Using Variance (MUV), which first learns several different base probabilistic classifiers, then for each query combines the responses of the different base classifiers based on their respective variances.

The original MUV learns the individual classifiers using bootstrap sampling of the training data; we modify this by considering different subsets of the features for each classifier. We derive a new combination rule for base classifiers in the proposed setting and obtain some new theoretical results. Based on characteristics of our task, we propose an approach that involves first clustering the features before selecting only a subset of features from each cluster for each base classifier.

Unfortunately, we were unable to predict radiation toxicity in prostate cancer patients using just the SNP values. However, our further experimental results reveal strong relation between correctness of a classifier in its prediction and the variance of the response to the corresponding classification query, which show that the main idea is promising.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examines the mechanisms of magnetic particle deposition and retention in human airways for magnetically targeted drug delivery. As this is a novel application, fundamental studies were performed to establish the necessary background knowledge for further development.

Magnetic particle deposition from an aerosol in simulated airway conditions was studied using numerical and experimental models. The model results showed qualitative agreement; discrepancies were due to particle aggregation, which enhances deposition. Aerosol flow rate had a limited effect; the main factor in effective deposition was the proximity of the particle trajectories to the magnets. This spatial bias shows the importance of particle distribution in the flow as well as magnetic field geometry. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of capturing magnet particles from aerosol in airway conditions.

For retention, clearance of particles due to motion of the mucus lining of the airways must be overcome. Particle retention was studied in vitro using various liquids to simulate mucus and identify relevant parameters. An ex vivo animal tissue model was used to demonstrate feasibility. Retention of 3-5 μm diameter iron particles was achieved at reduced liquid/mucus viscosities. Larger (~100 μm) particles were retained at normal mucus viscosities. The size dependence shows that particle aggregation after deposition is crucial for effective retention.

In vitro retention experiments showed aggregate size is correlated with liquid viscosity, i.e. formation of aggregates is limited by forces opposing particle motion along the mucus layer interface. To determine these forces, particle motion on various air-liquid interfaces, chosen to simulate different mucus properties in isolation, was studied. When surfactants are present, as in the mucus layer, particle motion is limited by a velocity-dependent surface tension gradient as well as viscous drag.

Pulling particles through the mucus layer into the tissue beneath was also considered as a potential retention strategy. The force required to pull particles through the mucus layer was also studied using various liquids to simulate mucus properties. In addition to the surface tension force holding the particles at the interface, hydrodynamic forces must be overcome to pull particles into or out of a liquid film such as the mucus layer.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: General Game Playing (GGP) deals with the design of players that are able to play any discrete, deterministic, complete information games. For many games like chess, designers develop a player using a specially designed algorithm and tune all the features of the algorithm to play the game as good as possible. However, a general game player knows nothing about the game that is about to be played. When the game begins, game description is given to the players and they should analyze it and decide on the best way to play the game.

In this thesis, we focus on two-player constant-sum simultaneous move games in GGP and how this class of games can be handled. Rock-paper-scissors can be considered as a typical example of a simultaneous move game. We introduce the CFR algorithm to the GGP community for the first time and show its effectiveness in playing simultaneous move games. This is the first implementation of CFR outside the poker world. We also improve the UCT algorithm, which is the state of the art in GGP, to be more robust in simultaneous move games.

In addition, we analyze how UCT performs in simultaneous move games and argue that it does not converge to a Nash equilibrium. We also compare the usage of UCT and CFR in this class of games. Finally, we discuss about the importance of opponent modeling and how a model of the opponent can be exploited by using CFR.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Evidence surrounding the role of multimorbidity in an acute care setting, as well as factors associated with improved health outcomes in this patient population, is significantly lacking.  Therefore, the objectives of this program of research were to determine the role of multimorbidity on short term morbidity and mortality in patients managed for an acute event and to evaluate the relationship between continuity of care and multimorbidity on short term morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk of adverse outcomes.  These objectives were achieved through two related studies. First, a prospective cohort study of 6000 patients with community- acquired pneumonia (CAP) was conducted to evaluate the impact of multimorbidity on 90-day death, hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visits. The results indicated that multimorbidity was common in a population of patients experiencing an acute event with one-third of all patients in our study having multimorbidity. Moreover, multimorbidity was independently associated with an increased risk of death, hospitalization, or return to ED within 90 days of discharge. Although multimorbidity is largely evaluated in patients with chronic conditions, the current research suggests that multimorbidity has a significant impact in acute conditions as well. Building upon these findings, the second study evaluated the potential role of continuity of care in mitigating the impact of multimorbidity in patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. Utilizing a retrospective cohort of almost 3000 patients with incident type 2 diabetes, a similar, independent association between better continuity of care and a lower risk of death or all-cause hospitalizations at 1 year, was observed for both patients with and without multimorbidity. Furthermore, similar to our previous study in acute care, multimorbidity was also associated with significant increased risk of adverse outcomes. Collectively, this research suggests that clinicians and health care systems need to implement strategies to mitigate the negative impact of multimorbidity on patients. A potentially effective approach to achieve this is to improve follow-up and optimize continuity of care. Although this approach is likely reasonable for both acute and chronic disease settings, further research is required to affirm these findings in acute settings. Regardless, when managing or making site-of-care decisions for patients in acute or chronic settings, more attention should be paid to comorbidities and multimorbid conditions a patient may have.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: As an energy storage device, the flywheel has significant advantages over conventional chemical batteries, including higher energy density, higher efficiency, longer life time, and less pollution to the environment. An effective flywheel system can be attributed to its good motor/generator (M/G) design. This thesis describes the research work on the design of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) as an M/G suitable for integration in a flywheel energy storage system within a large hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The operating requirements of the application include wide power and speed ranges combined with high total system efficiency. Along with presenting the design, essential issues related to PMSM design including cogging torque, iron losses and total harmonic distortion (THD) are investigated. An iterative approach combining lumped parameter analysis with 2D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used, and the final design is presented showing excellent performance.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Identifying spatial patterns of collisions is critical for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic enforcement deployment and road safety. Recently, many studies have centred on finding locations with high collision concentration, so-called hotspots. However, most of them only focus on the location information of the collision data, without integrating the non-spatial attributes into analysis. Taking non-spatial attributes into account opens opportunities to reveal attribute-related hotspots that otherwise goes undetected, and can add valuable indicators for explaining those hotspots. In this thesis, we address this problem. We propose a method for identifying the sets of non-spatial attribute-value pairs (AVPs) that together contribute significantly to the spatial clustering of the corresponding collisions. We call such AVP sets Spatial Co-Clustering Patterns (SCCPs). By applying our method on Edmonton’s collision data, we discovered larger numbers of meaningful hotspot patterns than traditional methods did, and revealed the relevant non-spatial indicators for explaining those hotspots.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Mining methods have changed and grown to fulfill extractive demands. Heavy machinery is used to extract overburden in open pit and open cast mines and to create waste dumps prone to slope stability issues. As the heaviest equipment operating on dump locations, mine haul trucks require a safe, stable surface to work on, so the stability of waste dumps is hugely important. Slope failures frequently occur on mine cut slopes, embankments, dumps, and road cut surfaces, so an improved understanding, monitoring, and support of such slopes is important to prevent failure, loss of equipment and fatalities. One of the most important differences between waste dump slopes and other slopes such as embankments or road cuts is not only that waste dumps are made up of loose face dumped material but also goes that trucks impact cyclic loads which affect stability. For example, significant weight at hundreds of tonnes has a huge impact on slope stability. This cyclic loading scenario on mine waste dumps has yet to be investigated fully.
This study looks at the stability of waste dumps under the impact of mining equipment based on physical modeling (laboratory scale tests), numerical modeling and “Slide” slope stability software. During the study on the stability of waste dumps by physical modeling, data related to rolling resistance was also recorded.
It has been concluded that the results from both the physical and numerical modeling determined acceptable states for truck path by both truck location for the chosen test material, Dolomitic limestone (1/3 and 1/2 truck width from crest), and constructing a safety berm along the crest of slope, and for wet conditions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Previous feminist sport media studies have noted that media narratives surrounding the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) often portray its successes as proof of feminist achievements in women’s sport (Banet-Weiser, 1999; McDonald, 2000, 2002; McDonald &amp; Cooky, 2013; Wearden &amp; Creedon, 2002). Using critical feminist perspectives, this research has further argued that these celebratory narratives of gender equality masked reproduction of hegemonic ideologies of masculinity and whiteness. Using a poststructuralist Deleuzian perspective, in my dissertation I focus on construction of normative female sporting bodies through the mediated WNBA. 
My dissertation consists of three cases studies on contemporary WNBA-related media events that each draw on a different Deleuzian concept. The first case study focuses on Diana Taurasi’s alleged drug use in Turkey during 2010/11. I use Deleuze’s concept of assemblage to analyze what elements were drawn in to express Taurasi’s drug using body and what structures were articulated within the process. Through this analysis, I describe a shift in attention from the bio-chemical effects of banned substances to the information processing regarding a doping body, as well as a split between Taurasi’s private and public body. I further argue that these movements enabled and reified two structures, American standard and professionalism, through which the normalcy of Taurasi’s athleticism was measured and declared.
The second case study focuses on Becky Hammon’s naturalization to Russia and representing the Russian Olympic team in 2008. I use Deleuze’s concept of cartography to map how two nations, the U.S. and Russia, were articulated through the ways in which Hammon was allowed to access and be affiliated with each spatial partition/nation in media. I depict a non-oppositional relation between the nations that legitimated Hammon’s migration to another country for her Olympic glory. This map shows that the supplementary space, Russia, could be correctly experienced only when it supports and nurtures the normative functions of the primary space, the US—such as Hammon’s “regular” job as a WNBA star.
The third case study focuses on Maya Moore’s first year with the WNBA in 2011. Using Deleuze’s concept of becoming, I examine the reoccurring “savior” narrative that surrounded Moore’s entrance to the WNBA in the media. I first demonstrate how the media illustrated Moore’s ability to redefine the WNBA. I further discuss how her normativity was constructed through athleticism and profitability rather than gender and race in the commodified media scape of women’s professional sports.
My Deleuzian analysis revealed a process of constructing normative professional athletes whose sporting bodies were primarily articulated through standards of the winning records and these athletes’ profitability. Therefore, a different type of ideal professional women basketball player from the feminized, sexualized, or racialized player traced by the previous feminist sport media research emerged. This media ideal continues, nevertheless, to be constructed within the commercialized context of the U.S. that emphasizes individual success and the superiority of the American professional sport.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The performance of structures under the effects of extreme loads can be a critical consideration in their design. The potential for disproportionate collapse following localized damage to a column can be mitigated by the provision of sufficient strength and ductility throughout a structural system to allow for the establishment of a stable alternative load path. An understanding of the behaviour of shear connections in steel gravity frames under the unique combinations of moment, shear, and axial force relevant to column removal scenarios is necessary to assess the vulnerability of a structure to disproportionate collapse. However, such an understanding is currently limited by a deficiency of physical test data.
In order to investigate the inherent robustness of commonly used steel shear connections, an experimental program consisting of 45 full scale physical tests was completed. Specimens included shear tab, welded–bolted single angle, bolted–bolted single angle, bolted–bolted double angle, and seat and top angle connections combined with different types of shear connections at the beam web. A testing procedure was developed that imposes upon a connection the force and deformation demands that are expected following removal of the central column in a symmetric two bay frame. Various geometric arrangements of each connection type were tested, and each arrangement was subjected to a range of loading histories representing different column removal scenarios.
The physical test results characterize the load development history, deformation mechanisms, and failure modes expected following column removal for each type of connection. Connection stiffness, strength, and ductility limits under the effects of combined loading are quantified.
An approach to mechanical modelling that predicts connection response following column removal is presented and validated using the test results. The models are used to expand the database of results and study the effects of critical parameters on performance. Design recommendations based on the physical tests and mechanical modelling are presented, including connection detailing considerations and a simplified connection modelling technique that is suitable for whole-building column removal analysis.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic, with a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Effective therapies have emerged for patients suffering from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF), but not for those with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Recently, systemic inflammation, driven by comorbid conditions, was attributed a larger role in the pathogenesis of HFPEF than HFREF. On the other hand, the role of the left atrium (LA) in HF remains unclear. Herein, the roles of inflammatory dysregulation and cardiac remodeling are explored in HF. The results presented suggest that dysregulation of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha axis may be a primary mediator of disease manifestations in HFPEF. The results show the LA plays variable role in in HF, whereby some patients rely on LA contraction for sufficient cardiac output. Altogether these findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge about the roles of inflammation and the LA in HF.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Space-based measurements of the Earth's magnetic field are required to understand the plasma processes of the solar-terrestrial connection which energize the Van Allen radiation belts and cause space weather. This thesis describes a fluxgate magnetometer payload developed for the proposed Canadian Space Agency’s Outer Radiation Belt Injection, Transport, Acceleration and Loss Satellite (ORBITALS) mission. The instrument can resolve 8 pT on a 65,000 nT field at 900 samples per second with a magnetic noise of less than 10 pT per square--root Hertz at 1 Hertz. The design can be manufactured from radiation tolerant (100 krad) space grade parts. A novel combination of analog temperature compensation and digital feedback simplifies and miniaturises the instrument while improving the measurement bandwidth and resolution. The prototype instrument was successfully validated at the Natural Resources Canada Geomagnetics Laboratory, and is being considered for future ground, satellite and sounding rocket applications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Canada has the largest known reserve of oil in the world in the form of oil sands: an estimated 1.7 to 2.5 trillion barrels of oil are deposited in combination of the sand, water and clay. 
The presented research is devoted to bubble-solid surface interaction, which is one of the critical areas of the oil sand processing and it is also a key point for many other processing technologies, such as mineral recovery, froth flotation, soil remediation, de inking of paper, heat transfer in boilers tube, biological and medical sciences.
The goal of this work was to investigate new theoretical and practical approaches, which would help in better understanding of fundamentals of the flotation process in oil sands extraction. Among many achievements of this research are:
1)	development of the method for generation of a single micro bubble. Dependence of this process on micropipette tip size and inclination, gas type, taper length and other parameters has also been studied (Chapter 3);
2)	study of gas bubble - flat surface interactions based on a practical approach of determination of two dynamic parameters, sliding velocity and induction time of a gas bubble. Various types of gas bubbles (CO2, Air, H2, and O2) and collector surfaces (bitumen, treated hydrophobic and hydrophilic silica) were used in sliding velocity and induction time measurements. The sliding velocity of gas bubbles under an inclined collector surface was found to be in a strong dependence of water chemistry, type of gases, temperature, initial separation between bubble and collector surface (Chapter 4);
3)	developing an analytical model for predicting bubble sliding velocity based on previously developed models. The model was in a good agreement with experimental results (Chapter 5);
4)	establishing a new method for bubble zeta potential measurements. The measurements were in a good agreement with previously studies reported in literature (Chapter 6). 
Summarized above findings from this research represent valuable advances in understanding oil sands processing. The prospects of future work are provided in Chapter 8.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are used as models of transport-reaction phenomena in a variety of different industrial chemical and materials engineering processes, and can yield precise descriptions of process variables with complex temporal and spatially dependent system dynamics. In many cases, the process dynamics are also affected by time-dependent features of the system which arise from the underlying physical characteristics of the process or the methods utilized in the formation and treatment of materials which may result in phase transitions, deformations or a combination of these behaviours. The dynamical analysis of these processes provides a fundamental basis for development of model based control strategies through a number of approaches including from within the framework of infinite-dimensional systems control theory. However, each class of transport-reaction system presents its own unique challenges and requires the development of new strategies within the existing framework. 

The focus of this thesis is the systematic treatment and realization of the feedback control design for two general classes of problems. The first class deals with the optimal boundary control problem for unstable parabolic PDEs with nonautonomous and nonhomogeneous infinite-dimensional system representation, and is considered within the context of a lithium-ion battery thermal regulation problem. The key challenges addressed include the time-dependence of system parameters, system instability, the restriction of the input along a portion of the battery domain boundary, the observer based optimal boundary control design, and the realization of the outback feedback control problem based on state measurement and interpolation methods. The second class of problems is the optimal distributed and boundary control of parabolic PDEs on time-varying spatial domains with nonautonomous infinite-dimensional system representation. The key challenges addressed include the development of an appropriate function space setting to handle the time-dependence of the spatial domain, the formulation of the infinite-dimensional system representation of the PDE control problem within this function space setting, and the realization of the optimal distributed and boundary control problems within the context of the Czochralski crystal temperature stabilization problem.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The proximal tubule (PT) is a major site of paracellular transport. Research in this area is undermined by the lack of a model system that is representative of PT electrophysiology. We examined opossum kidney (OK) cell characteristics and found a striking resemblance to the PT (transepithelial resistance = 11.7 Ω cm2 and the permeability ratio PNa+/PCl- = 1.08). Furthermore, OK cells express a number of claudins (claudin-4 &gt; -1 &gt; -6 &gt; -20 &gt; -9 &gt; -12 &gt; -11 &gt; -15, in order of the amount of expression), which are known to regulate paracellular transport. We over-expressed claudin-2 and found that it forms a non-selective pore at the tight junction of OK cells. Over-expression of claudin-4, on the other hand, led to the formation of a non-selective barrier. However, the expression of these isoforms caused significant perturbations in expression of endogenous claudins leading us to conclude that claudin expression is strongly interdependent.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Gypsum supersaturation in process water is known to have detrimental effects on flotation performance of sulphide minerals. The motivation of this research is to develop a better understanding of the impact of gypsum supersaturation in process water on sphalerite flotation. For this purpose, this thesis focused on the impacts of gypsum supersaturation in process water on the surface properties of silica and sphalerite minerals, the interactions between flotation reagents and sphalerite, and the interactions between silica and sphalerite minerals in various types of process water. 
Results from this study indicate that the adverse impact of gypsum supersaturation in process water on sphalerite flotation is mainly due to high calcium concentration in the gypsum supersaturated process water. This study shows that gypsum precipitates do not form or coat on silica and sphalerite mineral surfaces in the gypsum supersaturated solutions under the conditions studied. However, both silica and sphalerite mineral surfaces are coated by calcium after being conditioned in a gypsum supersaturated solution, resulting in identical surface charge between silica and sphalerite. The high calcium concentration in the gypsum supersaturated process water is found to retard the activation of sphalerite by copper and hence the subsequent xanthate adsorption. The adsorption of calcium ions is identified to compete with copper species for the reactive surface sites of sphalerite, resulting in the reduction in copper and xanthate uptake and hence flotation recovery of sphalerite. Hetero-aggregation between gangue minerals (quartz or silica for example) and sphalerite minerals is induced in the gypsum supersaturated process water. Direct colloidal force measurement using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows attractive force profile between silica and sphalerite minerals in both gypsum supersaturated solution and calcium chloride solution containing a similar calcium concentration to that of the gypsum supersaturated solution. The extent of slime coating of silica nanoparticles on sphalerite surfaces is found to increase with the increase in calcium concentration. The retardation of sphalerite activation and subsequent xanthate adsorption, in combination with slime coating of gangue mineral particles results in poor recovery and selectivity in sphalerite flotation process. 
Removing calcium ions by sodium carbonate addition can significantly offset the detrimental effect of gypsum supersaturated process water on the flotation performance of sphalerite. Micro-flotation of silica and sphalerite mixture minerals shows that the flotation recovery and selectivity of sphalerite are clearly improved after treating the gypsum supersaturated solutions with sodium carbonate.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Evaluation use is an area of research with important implications for
evaluation theory and practice. A review of the evaluation use literature reveals
the factors that affect evaluation use provide important implications for evaluation
practice (Burr, 2009; Cousins &amp; Leithwood, 1986). Using a concurrent,
phenomenological approach, the current study examined a model forwarded by
Peck and Gorzalski (2009) within an ongoing program evaluation at two sites.
Three findings emerged from the analysis revealing implications for evaluation
practice and research.
1) Conceptual and process use occurred at both sites.
2) Evaluation factors appeared to specifically affect process use, while
contextual factors appeared to affect use in general.
3) Organizational receptiveness of evaluation and the evaluator’s role
emerged as two contextual factors affecting use.
The study also provides implications for evaluation use research, as the
use of concurrent, qualitative methods used appear to be effective in investigating
the factors affecting use.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The interest of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for civil application has increased dramatically in recent years. With improvement in computer hardware, lightweight sensors, and light material, the cost of UAVs has reduced significantly. UAVs with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities have been the focus of much development. A mathematical model for a scale RC helicopter including the rotor dynamics is presented in this work. The main rotor lift slope CL, the main rotor aerodynamic drag coefficient CDo,  and the moments of inertia about the center of gravity are determined by the use of two sets of HIL testbeds.  The avionics instrumentation, communication protocol and Ground Station system are described in detail. Finally, the model linearization and the LQR/LQG compensator in output feedback configuration with reference inputs are presented. Simulation results show that the proposed compensator stabilized and control the linearized dynamic of the helicopter.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The influence of the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state on specific phenotypic traits of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as well as its transport behaviour in porous media was examined in this study.  E.coli O157:H7 is a human pathogen capable of entering a VBNC state following exposure to sublethal stress.  In the VBNC state, E.coli O157:H7 is not detectable by culture assays; yet, is able to retain its ability to cause human illness. This study examined specific transport-related properties of culturable and VBNC E.coli O157:H7 cells.  As well, transport behaviors of the two cellular states were compared using sand-packed columns under steady-state flow.  When E.coli O157:H7 cells entered a VBNC state, significant decreases in the hydrophobicity and lengths/widths of the cells, and a significant increase in extracellular polymeric substances on the cell surfaces were measured.  Transport experiments indicated significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater mass transport of VBNC cells through unwashed sand compared to culturable cells.  This research contributes to the current knowledge describing VBNC E.coli O157:H7 cells, raises questions concerning the accuracy of culture-based E.coli O157:H7 identification protocols, and suggests that bacteria transport in the subsurface is a truly dynamic process.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Utilization of renewable bioenergy is a sustainable approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, efficient use of this resource is hindered by the current knowledge-gaps concerning collecting and processing dispersed biomass from large areas. This study focuses on developing methodologies for assessing biomass-based facilities; availability of agri-biomass; their densification, energy and emissions compared to other fuels; transport logistics; and biofacility siting with optimum capacities analyzed in the GIS (geographical information system) environment. Densification of agricultural residue into pellets for fuels and chemicals was considered in the analyses. Agricultural pellets were ranked in order of preference using multi-criteria decision analysis which integrates economic, environmental and technical factors. The results show that straw pellets possess significant potential; they rank immediately after wood and switchgrass pellets for all scenarios. A data-intensive techno-economic model was developed to determine the optimum size of plants and the minimum cost of pellet production and the optimum capacity for pellet plants was 150,000 tonnes per year. To establish the supply logistics of large-scale biofacilities, a methodology was developed to assess the optimum delivery cost of multiple forms of lignocellulosic feedstocks. It was found that the optimal delivery mode can be achieved by combining 30% agricultural bales with 70% forest biomass in the form of wood chips. Agri-pellets’ potential to offsetting GHG emissions is 50% – 350% higher than that of  other fuel sources such as wood pellets, coal and natural gas.  A procedural model was developed within the GIS environment to determine an optimal system of biofacilities, considering environmental and economic factors. This methodology was applied to Alberta, and a land-suitability model was derived. The optimal capacity and cost change considerably in suitable locations. Methodologies developed under this study would be useful for optimal planning and siting of biofacilities in suitable geographical locations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Sea ice concentration (SIC), the length of the ice-free period, and the break-up date are correlated with the survival and reproduction success of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in Western Hudson Bay (WH). I use a high-resolution sea ice-ocean model to predict these parameters through the 21st century and to assess the threat on polar bears in WH. The model was validated and calibrated with GPS-data from polar bears in WH. Predictions are based on the IPCC greenhouse gas-emission scenarios: B1, A1B and A2. The model predicted significant changes in WH spring SIC in A1B and A2, and in the seasonal ice cycle in B1, A1B and A2. From 2061-2100, the mean break-up date advances 15.7 days (B1), 31.5 days (A1B), and 46 days (A2), and the mean ice-free period lengthens by 4.5 weeks (B1), 8.4 weeks (A1B), and 12.5 weeks (A2). Should the model projections be realized, a viable population of polar bears will not likely persist in WH until the end of this century.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The overall goal of this thesis was to develop a proof-of-principle for a device that might eventually restore walking in people with paraplegia. The thesis consisted of three component technologies each working in conjunction with one another in adult cats. The first component was the state-based control algorithm, which provided a framework to implement more detailed control of locomotion in the future. The goal of this study was to develop a physiologically based algorithm capable of mimicking the biological system to control multiple joints in the lower extremities for producing over-ground walking. The biological central pattern generator (CPG) integrates open and closed loop control to produce over-ground walking. Similarly, the algorithm used combined open and closed loop control of a state-based model of the step cycle.  Each state produced different electrical stimulation patterns and activated a different combination of muscles. This study verified that such a controller could generate closed loop bilateral overground walking. The second study implemented a novel type of functional electrical stimulation, intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS), that activated motor networks in the ventral horn of the spinal cord that would remain intact below the lesion level after a spinal cord injury. In addition to producing movements around single joints, ISMS through individual microwires can elicit coordinated multi-joint movements and the resulting contractions are fatigue-resistant. For the first time, we demonstrate sustainable, bilateral over-ground walking using ISMS. The walking proved to be extremely fatigue-resistant with some cats walking for a distance of over 800 m. The third study added natural sensory feedback of both the limb position in space and ground reaction force using recordings of neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The goal of this study was to decode sensory information from the DRG in real time for control of unilateral ISMS stepping. These predictions were successfully used to activate a closed loop rule that limited backward hyperextension. Each project resulted in a novel accomplishment and produced a deliverable that successfully worked in conjunction with previously developed components toward a neuroprosthetic device to restore walking.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Phase retrieval in the transmission electron microscope offers the unique potential to collect quantitative data regarding the electric and magnetic properties of materials at the nanoscale. Substantial progress in the field of quantitative phase imaging was made by improvements to the technique of off-axis electron holography. In this thesis, several breakthroughs have been achieved that improve the quantitative analysis of phase retrieval. An accurate means of measuring the electron wavefront coherence in two-dimensions was developed and pratical applications demonstrated. The detector modulation-transfer function (MTF) was assessed by slanted-edge, noise, and the novel holographic techniques. It was shown the traditional slanted-edge technique underestimates the MTF. In addition, progress was made in dark and gain reference normalization of images, and it was shown that incomplete read-out is a concern for slow-scan CCD detectors. Last, the phase error due to electron shot noise was reduced by the technique of summation of hologram series. The phase error, which limits the finest electric and magnetic phenomena which can be investigated, was reduced by over 900 % with no loss of spatial resolution. Quantitative agreement between the experimental root-mean-square phase error and the analytical prediction of phase error was achieved.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Thermal cracking of the vacuum residue fraction of bitumen and petroleum is an important feature of several refinery processes. At normal process temperatures, this fraction remains liquid, which favors coke formation. In order to understand the reaction yields and intrinsic reaction kinetics of this important material at temperatures above 600°C, innovative reactor designs and techniques were developed.  
First, a microstructured mixer was used to rapidly heat reactants to nearly constant reaction temperatures in a few milliseconds. The reactor was tested by studying of the rate of the thermal cracking of n-hexadecane temperatures ranging from 600 to 750°C, at atmospheric pressure, and mean residence time of 110 to 170 milliseconds. The apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor for the over all first order reaction was calculated as 235 kJ/mol and 1.1×1013 s-1 respectively, consistent with the majority of previous studies in the literature.

In order to minimize the role of the liquid phase in cracking of vacuum residue, an aerosol reactor was designed and constructed. Thermal cracking of Athabasca vacuum residue was studied at temperatures of 700 to 800°C at atmospheric pressure and residence time of 100 to 115 milliseconds. The feed was introduced as submicron droplets into the reactor. Alkenes were the dominant components among the gas products, with total yield of ethene and propene ranging from 5 to 18 wt %.The yield of coke was 6.3 wt% on average, and was insensitive to conversion of the vacuum residue. Both these observations were consistent with the predominance of vapour-phase reactions. , The molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon decreased monotonically with conversion from 1.4 for unconverted feed to 0.98 at 78% conversion, consistent with high yields of hydrogen-rich gas products.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Canada’s boreal forest is the breeding ground for some 288 species of resident and migratory birds.  Approximately 65% of the species that are currently of highest conservation priority in the boreal region are associated with wetlands and riparian areas. Although estimates vary with scale and specific geographic boundaries, wetlands (open water, marshes, fens, bogs and swamps) and other aquatic areas occupy between 20-60% of the boreal landscape. These ecosystems are interspersed with uplands resulting in a heterogeneous landscape hosting a wide variety of transitions, or ecotones, including riparian areas among and within aquatic, wetland and terrestrial systems.  Like most ecosystems worldwide, riparian areas within Canada's boreal forests face increasing environmental pressure from the cumulative effects of climate change and unprecedented rates of anthropogenic landscape modification. My objectives were to advance understanding of boreal riparian and wetland-associated bird communities and to evaluate emerging community-level metrics for comparing different habitats and measuring effects of human disturbance.  First, I characterized species composition and ecological characteristics of boreal riparian areas associated with open water wetlands which represent a broad spectrum of riparian habitats available to boreal birds. This work demonstrated that riparian zones associated with boreal plain wetlands (shallow lakes and ponds) act as a source of unique bird species and that community dynamics of these ecotones were different from that of upland bird communities.  More specifically, I found that bird species composition was more variable in riparian areas than upland sites.  I also found that riparian areas supported bird communities that were less specialized in their habitat preferences than those in upland areas.
To explore these findings further, I examined whether applying an accepted wetland classification scheme would refine current understanding of habitat associations for birds. My analysis showed that despite some overlap in community composition among wetlands of roughly similar habitat structure (i.e., shrubby wetlands), boreal riparian bird communities were structured differently among a broad suite of wetland classes.  This work also showed that wetland communities were distinct from upland communities of similar structure created by forest harvesting.  Using indices of ecological function and resilience based on ecological traits of the bird community to compare riparian and upland bird communities, I found riparian bird assemblages possess a different suite of functional traits, higher functional diversity, and greater resilience than the other areas of the landscape I examined.
Finally I used, Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), a technique developed specifically for identifying community-level thresholds (Baker), to explore species-level changes at wetlands along a gradient of agricultural conversion. I compared two spatial scales (local and landscape level) and two geographic regions one in Northeastern Alberta with extensive relatively intact boreal forest immediately to the north and another forested landscape in South western Manitoba embedded in a matrix of agricultural conversion. Community-level changes appeared more abrupt at the landscape than wetland scales but tended to occur over a wide portion of the disturbance gradient, providing only equivocal evidence for community-level thresholds. Species responding positively to agricultural conversion were more typical of open country regions. Species that responded negatively were generally those for which loss of forest cover represented direct loss of habitat. For species common to both regions, specific change points differed but direction of response (+ or -) was consistent. 
	Taken together evidence presented here supports other boreal studies that have shown that for bird communities riparian areas are ecologically unique. They support species rich and subsequently, functionally rich bird communities structured to be more resilient than upland communities. However, even when forest is retained around the periphery of boreal wetlands, conversion to agriculture in the surrounding landscape resulted in species assemblages more typical of open prairie landscapes. Thus my work clearly describes patterns community composition and points to future research necessary to ensure conservation of boreal wetlands and associated bird communities.  Greater consideration of ecological traits and community level approaches will compliment species-level work and assist in developing effective conservation and sustainable land use strategies.  Data from long term studies of boreal forest bird communities that strategically consider both species- and ecosystem-level changes in boreal bird assemblages in response to environmental gradients over time and including human disturbances will be critical to this effort.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Fungal polyketides, a vast source for pharmaceutical industries, are biosynthesized by multifunctional iterative polyketide synthases (PKS). The biosynthesis employs complex programming rules, which are currently unresolved. To decode the programming rules, the biosynthesis of three polyketides, hypothemycin, radicicol and dehydrocurvularin were investigated via heterologous reconstitution of corresponding PKSs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ5464-NpgA. The biosyntheses of hypothemycin and radicicol share significant similarity. They both employ a pair of highly reducing PKS (HRPKS) and non-reducing PKS (NRPKS): the HRPKSs (Hpm8 and Rdc5) construct the reduced portions of the PKS-product backbones, whereas the NRPKSs (Hpm3 and Rdc1) synthesize the aromatic portions. To determine the distribution of reactions between HRPKS and NRPKS in the two biosynthetic systems, putative biosynthetic intermediates (27 for hypothemycin and 149 for radicicol) were synthesized as their S-N-acetylcysteamine (SNAC) thioesters. We found that hypothemycin biosynthesis employs a 6+3 distribution of reactions, but radicicol biosynthesis uses a 5+4 distribution of reactions. 
The substrate-dependent stereospecificity of Hpm8 ketoreductase (KR) was investigated by incubating Hpm8 with a series of β-keto SNAC thioesters. The KR domain stereospecificity was found to be dependent only on substrate chain lengths; the KR domain reduced the β-keto groups of diketides (4 carbon) to L-hydroxyl groups, but reduced all other β-keto intermediates to D-hydroxyl groups. This unprecedented, switchable stereospecificity suggests that iterative PKSs are more complex than previous thought, and that the substrate-PKS interactions play a significant role in iterative PKS programming. To fully investigate the substrate-HRPKS interactions, a series of 13C-labeled, partially assembled precursors were synthesized and assayed with Hpm8 and Hpm3. Our data suggest that Hpm8 prefers substrates resembling biosynthetic intermediates after the reductive modifications.
The putative gene cluster of dehydrocurvularin was uncovered via genomic sequencing of producing strain Alternaria cinerariae. A pair of HRPKS (Dhc3) and NRPKS (Dhc5) was identified, analogous to hypothemycin and radicicol biosynthesis. Both PKS genes were cloned into expression plasmids, and the gene products were successfully expressed and purified from BJ5464-NpgA. In vivo reconstitution of DHC production in BJ5464-NpgA containing genes encoding Dhc3 and Dhc5 was not successful. Other cryptic enzymes may be involved in the biosynthesis of DHC.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase‐2 (MMP‐2) was recently revealed to have targets and
actions within the cardiac myocyte. In ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, MMP‐2 is
activated and degrades troponin I (TnI) and α‐actinin. The regulation of intracellular
MMP‐2 activity is relatively unknown and is thus the subject of this thesis.
The localization of MMP‐2 in caveolae of endothelial cells suggests that
caveolin‐1 (Cav‐1) may play a role in regulating MMP‐2. Whether Cav‐1 is responsible
for regulating MMP‐2 in the heart is unknown.
A Cav‐1 knockout mouse model was used to explore the role Cav‐1 may play in
the regulation of MMP‐2 activity. The initial studies found that MMP‐2 and Cav‐1 were
co‐localized in cardiomyocytes and that MMP‐2 activity in Cav‐1‐/‐ hearts was markedly
enhanced. Additionally, the caveolin scaffolding domain inhibited MMP‐2 activity in a
concentration‐dependent manner.
To explore whether increased MMP‐2 in Cav‐1‐/‐ hearts translates to impaired
cardiac function, Cav‐1+/+ and Cav‐1‐/‐ isolated working hearts were physiologically
challenged with increasing increments of left atrial preload followed by increasing
concentrations of isoproterenol. Cav‐1‐/‐ hearts show similar or better cardiac function
compared to Cav‐1+/+ hearts following preload challenge or β‐adrenergic stimulation in
vitro, and this appears unrelated to changes in MMP‐2.
Though the function of Cav‐1‐/‐ hearts appears similar to that of Cav‐1+/+ hearts
during physiological situations, whether this is the case during I/R injury is not known.
Cav‐1+/+ and Cav‐1‐/‐ isolated working mouse hearts exposed to global, no‐flow ischemia
showed no functional differences. However, Cav‐1‐/‐ hearts had significantly higher
levels of both TnI and α‐actinin following I/R than Cav‐1+/+ hearts.
Post‐translational modifications of the intracellular MMP‐2 substrates could alter
susceptibility to MMP‐2 proteolysis. Isolated working mouse hearts were exposed to
isoproterenol and/or I/R injury to examine the phosphorylation status of TnI.
Isoproterenol and I/R both result in the phosphorylation of TnI, however, isoproterenol
lead to a more highly phosphorylated form of TnI than that observed in hearts exposed
I/R alone.
These and subsequent studies will further reveal the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the complex interactions between Cav‐1 and MMP‐2. This may eventually lead
to a novel avenue of therapeutic intervention for heart diseases.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for high quality evidence generation pertaining to treatment effectiveness. RCT results are used in knowledge synthesis and evidence-based practice. The validity of RCT results is dependent upon the validity of the primary outcome measures. Primary outcomes and the measurement properties of the primary outcome measures should be clearly reported to enable confident interpretation of results. A systematic review of pediatric RCTs published in high impact journals found inadequate reporting of primary outcomes and the measurement properties of their outcome measures. Furthermore, quality assessments of the measurement properties and the methodology of the studies in which the properties are evaluated suggest a need for further validation. The issue is thus twofold: inadequate reporting paired with insufficient validation. The awareness of this dual issue can encourage higher reporting standards and improved conduct of trials to ultimately enhance the quality of primary research.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb stainless steel alloys are commonly used in hydrogen reformer manifolds for transporting hot hydrogen by-products at 750-950 celcius. After long periods of exposure, embrittling secondary carbides and intermetallic phases can precipitate at the grain boundaries which can drastically reduce the ductility, and the repair weldability of the alloy. The intermetallic silicide, G-phase, is commonly observed in 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb stainless steels, and is prone to liquation cracking during welding operations. G-phase is deleterious to the material, where a high degree of G-phase coarsening will render the material unweldable.

The present work will investigate various methods in mitigating G-phase precipitation. Variations in casting methods, wall thickness, homogenization treatments, and alloy chemistry will be examined by evaluating their microstructure after periodically aging the samples. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling using computational thermodynamic tools will be used to optimize the 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb chemistry following ASTM specifications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Children’s play has emerged as a global discourse (Fleer, 2009). Studies from diverse theoretical traditions have examined the role of play in child development; however, the dominant discourse of play has largely privileged Western European-heritage cultural practices, and as a result childhood and play have become decontextualized (Kirova, 2010; Steinberg &amp; Kincheloe, 2004). While there is increasing acceptance that play is universal (Frost, Wortham, &amp; Reifel, 2008), it must also be recognized that there is still relatively little that is known about children’s play in non-Western and developing contexts (Göncü, Jain, &amp; Tuermer, 2007). Therefore, this action research study contributes to the growing body of literature in the field of play and cultural studies by exploring Thai views of children’s play. 

The study was conducted with a Thai nongovernmental organization called the Foundation for Child Development (FCD), and was carried out at one of their play centres in an urban low-income congested community. The purpose was to generate new and deeper thinking about play in order to collaboratively (re)construct practices aimed at enhancing children’s play opportunities at FCD. Data collection took place from November 2009 – 2010 and included volunteer work and participant observation at the children’s play centre. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with FCD staff members and community members. Additionally, a participatory photography research project was conducted with a group of children at the centre. 
The study was guided by a cultural-ecological conceptual framework. The findings suggest that play is a culturally structured activity that must be situated contextually. A sociocultural-historical perspective reveals that trends of urbanization and modernization are rapidly changing the landscape of childhood; therefore, it is important to consider the interaction between the global and local elements that are shaping children’s play within the contemporary Thai context. The study also calls attention to the importance of having access to play spaces, as they may become meaningful places for children to play and develop. Actions resulting from this study included increasing children’s participation in the planning of their play space and a children’s photo exhibition to raise awareness of the child’s right to play.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Childhood obesity has risen dramatically over recent decades in Canada, attributed largely to increasingly obesogenic environments. Our understanding of obesity now recognizes its complex ecological etiology, yet life skills – critical to how children engage with their surroundings – have been overlooked. The provincially representative 2012 REAL Kids Alberta survey of grade 5 students and their parents included novel questions assessing leadership skills of students according to the 7 habits model of The Leader in Me, which aligns well with life skills.
This thesis investigates the validity of these leadership questions, and the associations between leadership, as a model of life skills, and children’s health behaviours – diet quality, physical activity, and sleep duration – and bodyweight status. Results indicate that leadership is strongly associated with diet quality and physical activity in children, and should be a priority for understanding and addressing the obesity epidemic and the health of children.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by their complex cell envelope, which consists of the inner membrane, outer membrane, and intervening periplasmic space. Envelope-localized proteins play a critical role in many interactions of a bacterium with its environment, including uptake of nutrients, extrusion of waste, adhesion to surfaces, and motility. As such, regulation of envelope protein expression is crucial to the survival of Gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli. Two regulatory systems involved in controlling envelope protein expression are the Cpx envelope stress response and small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). The Cpx response is believed to sense misfolding of inner membrane and periplasmic proteins; in response, Cpx increases the transcription of a suite of genes encoding envelope-localized protein folding and degrading factors. sRNAs, with assistance from the RNA chaperone protein Hfq, base-pair with target mRNAs to modulate their rate of translation and/or stability. The first goal of this thesis was to examine the regulatory effects of the Cpx response and sRNAs upon the expression of the bundle-forming pilus (BFP), an envelope-localized protein complex that mediates initial interaction of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) with host cells. We found that the Cpx response affects BFP expression at multiple levels. Activation of the Cpx response represses transcription of the bfp gene cluster and prevents BFP expression, while inactivation of the Cpx response diminishes BFP expression at the post-translational level, as a result of decreased expression of periplasmic protein folding factors. The RNA chaperone Hfq also represses transcription of the bfp genes by destabilizing the perA transcript, which encodes the major regulator of bfp transcription. A second goal of this work was to characterize the interactions between the Cpx response and sRNAs. I demonstrated that the Cpx response regulates the expression of four sRNA-encoding genes. Conversely, Hfq and sRNAs also affect activity of the Cpx response, as deletion of hfq in EPEC activates the Cpx pathway, while overexpression of the sRNA RprA diminishes Cpx activity. These results deepen our understanding of how regulatory systems attune envelope protein expression to environmental and physiological conditions, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of EPEC and related organisms.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Third-generation optoelectronics, which utilize nanoscale materials, have received a considerable amount of attention in the chemical sciences and are poised to make a large impact in both fundamental research and real-world application. In order to make a contribution to the field, this thesis describes a route towards highly stable, water-soluble semiconductor nanorods and their incorporation into nanoparticle/polymer composite thin films. To characterize the photoelectrical properties of these multilayers, and to provide a proof-of-concept for a functional optoelectronic device, the films were integrated into an excitonic solar cell. To gain further insight into the physical properties of the thin films, computational modeling of the carrier transport in thiophenes was conducted, and the limits to device performance were described in the context of their charge transport characteristics.
Electrostatic layer-by-layer (ELBL) assembly was used for the synthesis of multilayer nanorod/polymer composite films. CdSe nanorods (NRs) were synthesized and made cationic and water-soluble using ligand exchange chemistry. The NRs were partnered with anionic polymers including poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the two polythiophene-based photoactive polymers, sodium poly[2-(3-thienyl)-ethoxy-4-butylsulfonate (PTEBS) and poly[3-(potassium-6-hexanoate)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3KHT).
Multilayer growth, with nanoscale control, is shown through UV-vis spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface
analytical techniques including atomic force microscopy (AFM). The formation of an intimate nanorod/conducting polymer bulk heterojunction is confirmed through cross-sectional SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning Auger analysis. A series of photovoltaic devices was fabricated on ITO electrodes using CdSe NRs in combination with PTEBS or P3KHT. A thorough device analysis showed that performance was limited by carrier transport throughout the films.
Computational modeling of the thiophene component in polymer-based third-generation devices was done using density functional theory (DFT) with core potentials added to account for long range dispersion interactions inherent to optoelectronic thin films. Binding energies and orbital splittings in dimers composed of monomers up to six rings were investigated. The combination of experimental and computational studies elucidates some of the underlying mechanisms behind the production of third-generation solar energy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Within the field of mathematics teacher education, mathematics graduate students have recently become subjects of investigation. While research in this area tends to focus on future schoolteachers, little has been done to examine prospective university teachers of mathematics and their understanding of its teaching and learning. As a result, the experiences of mathematics graduate students and the development of their teaching practices are not well understood. Almost seventy-five percent of mathematics PhDs will become professors at post-secondary institutions dedicated to undergraduate education. Since much of their careers will be spent in the classroom, attending to the manner in which mathematics graduate students develop their teaching practices is important in understanding how they are shaped for their future profession.
The purpose of this research project was to uncover issues and difficulties that arise as mathematics graduate students develop their views of their possible future roles as university teachers of mathematics. Over a six-month period, conversations were held with six mathematics graduate students exploring their experiences of and perspectives on mathematics teaching. Using hermeneutic inquiry and thematic analysis, the conversations were analysed and interpreted with attention to themes and experiences that had the potential to influence the graduate students’ ideas about and approaches to the task of teaching. 
	This dissertation also attends to notions of identity for mathematics graduate students, in particular their emerging identities as mathematicians and what being a mathematician in the world means to them, as well as their identities as future post-secondary teachers of mathematics. The structures and expectations of behaviour within their department of mathematics had implications for how the participants formed their identities as mathematicians and mathematics teachers. Lave and Wenger’s notion of legitimate peripheral participation is explored with regard to the meta-themes that came through the analysis. These meta-themes are: replication – where university mathematics teacher identity and classroom practices became a process of replication; resignation – the research participants felt resigned to one particular way of being in mathematics and of mathematics teaching; and despondence – the participants were beginning to lose their excitement about becoming post-secondary teachers of mathematics.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis, I explore the experiences of some 2,000 allied civilians in the Japanese-run Weihsien Internment Camp (濰縣集中營) in Shandong, China from 1943 to 1945. Beyond serving as a counterpoint to the Japanese internment in North America during the Second World War, the Weihsien Camp also represents a rare point of contact between Western civilians and the Japanese that came about as part of Japan's effort to sweep away any remaining vestiges of Western colonial society in Asia. Government documents, supplemented by both published and unpublished memoirs, letters, and diaries reveal the ways in which the internee community organised camp life under Japanese guard in a manner that defies straightforward categorisation as either "resistance" or "collaboration." Instead, the internees as a community reached an accommodation to the realities of life in a Japanese internment camp that allowed them considerable latitude and agency in their daily life.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study describes the strength, toughness and strain-rate sensitivity of fibre-reinforced cement-based foams subjected to variable loading rates. Drop-weight impact tests were conducted on beams with cast density between 475 - 1200 kg/cu.m. The study shows that under quasi-static loading, the compressive strength, elastic modulus and the modulus of rupture of plain mixes scale with the square of the relative density. On the other hand, the flexural toughness factor scaled linearly with it. Fibres were seen to increase the flexural strength at all rates of loading, regardless of cast density. Further, cement based foams were seen to be strain-rate sensitive.

The resistance of cement-based foams to sulphate exposure was also investigated. Heavier cement-based foams are more susceptible to sulphate attack and perform poorly with an increase in the duration of exposure when compared to the lightest mix which showed improved responses up to 30 days of exposure due to self-healing.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Conservation risk is spatially and taxonomically variable, affected by both biological (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) factors. To better understand this variability, I examined how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced sub-national patterns of conservation risk in North America for 43 avian and 37 mammalian scavengers. Conservation risk for avian species was most influenced by life history and behavioral traits, while conservation risk for mammalian species was determined more by range size, body mass and human disturbance. Correlations between conservation statuses of scavengers suggested that co-extirpations might be due to losses of behavioral interactions among highly interactive scavengers. These losses may contribute to observed patterns in conservation risk. The most interactive species were ravens, black and grizzly bears, gray wolves and river otters. These findings emphasize the importance of behavioural interactions among species on conservation status. I suggest that dependencies be examined prior to reintroduction efforts, with multi-species reintroductions considered.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this dissertation, I use a hermeneutic framework drawing on critical and postcolonial theory and interpretive inquiry (narrative analysis) to explore the postsecondary curriculum for German as a foreign language and culture (GFL) in Canada, its history, and its current manifestation, in relation to the twenty-first-century Canadians who study it. I pursue the questions, What is the GFL curriculum? How did it come about? What is it like for students? and What would curriculum innovation look like if it were based on students’ interests?
In part one, I discuss research paradigms, the influence of hermeneutics, the research process, the role of the researcher, and my research acts. In part two, I critique the history of GFL as taught at university in Canada. In part three, I examine the subject positions that have informed that history. I find that the Canadian postsecondary GFL curriculum reflects and benefits the symbolic sociocultural position of native-speaker literary professors and not the educational needs and interests of nonnative-speaker students. The Canadian postsecondary GFL curriculum has been articulated by a cross-cultural divide and withheld knowledge. Using postcolonial perspectives, I propose the diaspora and the less native speaker as potentially counter-hegemonic positions from which to conceptualize the teachers and learners of GFL and reconstruct the curriculum.
I follow these initial theoretical analyses with four narrative analyses based on interviews with four Canadian undergraduate students of GFL that
explored their experiences of instructional materials, teaching approaches, and curriculum design. The narratives include an episodic account, a mock epic, a psychological case with allegorical digressions, and an allegorical tale and tell of an unrequited love, a quest, shame, and an anti-quest in order to reveal how some are failed by existing curricula and yet make progress toward their linguistic and intercultural goals. In the final chapter, I present a fictional case study of a small German program where I have attempted to rethink curriculum and instruction based on the perspectives and student experiences explored in the previous chapters. I thus offer new vantage points from which to understand the GFL curriculum and enact more constructive teaching and learning.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Coalbeds are an extremely complicated porous medium with characteristics of heterogeneity, dual porosity and stress sensitivity. In the past decades great achievements have been made to the simulation models of pressure depletion coalbed methane (CBM) recovery process and CO2 sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery process. However, some important mechanisms are still not or not properly included. Among them, the influence of geomechanics is probably the most important one. Because of its influence coalbed permeability, the key parameter for the success of recovery processes, changes drastically with alterations of in situ stresses and strains during these processes. In present reservoir simulators, the change of coalbed permeability is estimated with analytical models. Due to the assumptions and over simplifications analytical models have limitations or problems in application. 

In this research to properly estimate the changes of permeability and porosity in the simulation of CO2 sequestration and ECBM recovery process, comprehensive permeability and porosity models have been developed with minimum assumptions and simulation methods established. Firstly, a set of continuum medium porosity and permeability coupling models is built up and a simulation procedure to apply these models in reservoir and geomechanical coupled simulations proposed. Using the models and simulation procedure a sensitivity study, mainly on the parameters related to coalbed permeability change and deformation, has been made for the CBM recovery process. Then based on the understanding, a set of discontinuum medium porosity and permeability coupling models is developed and a procedure to apply these models in reservoir and geomechanical coupled simulations presented. The new models are more comprehensive and adaptable, and can accommodate a wide range of coalbeds and in situ conditions. The proposed equivalent continuum deformation model for coal mass is validated by simulating a set of lab tests including a uniaxial compression test in vacuum and a CO2 swelling test under axial constraint in the longitudinal (vertical) direction. At last the discontinuum medium porosity and permeability coupling models and the simulation procedure are successfully applied to simulate part of a series of micro-pilot tests of ECBM and CO2 sequestration at Fenn Big Valley of Alberta, Canada.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This autobiographical narrative inquiry takes the reader alongside my familial stories of gardening and my lived experiences across three community gardens in Edmonton. By focusing on my experiences of gardening I demonstrate the power of narrative inquiry (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000) as an approach that tends to the descriptive and paradoxical dynamics of leisure practice by providing alternative narratives to dominant conceptualizations of gardening. The institutional, community and personal narratives of gardening that wove in and through my experiences of gardening are used to show how leisures are polythetic constructions situated in contexts with people, cultures and communities (Fox &amp; Klaiber, 2006). As the narratives in this thesis illustrate, gardeners continually negotiate tensious landscapes and stories of gardening. To ignore the rich and multivariate experiences of gardeners amongst the meta-narratives of gardening is to silence the moments of discomfort, dissent and alternatives in the diversity of lives lived.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by involuntary weight loss, wasting of skeletal muscle driven by reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. Cachexia has a negative impact on quality of life, response to chemotherapy and survival. Cachexia research is undeveloped with respect to understanding molecular changes involved and its classification / diagnostic criteria (there are no clinically useful predictors and diagnostic tests). The purpose of this research was to take advantage of gene expression (transcriptomic) and metabolite (metabolomic) profiling to address these gaps.
Patients with cancer consented to provide skeletal muscle biopsy (n=134) for gene expression array or plasma and urine (n=93) for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.  Omic data output was examined in relation to different dimensions of cachexia phenotype; gene expression was examined in relation to weight loss, muscle mass and muscle radiation attenuation and metabolites were examined in relation to muscle loss, muscle and fat mass, metabolic rate and food intake. Statistical analysis included standard statistical tests and machine learning methods.
Muscle gene expression varied strongly in relation to muscle attenuation, and to a much lesser degree with weight loss and muscle mass. Differential expression suggests low attenuation muscle has persistent inflammation, increased degradation, altered energy metabolism, increased extracellular matrix components and altered growth signalling. Urinary metabolites reflected muscle mass and to a lesser extent fat mass, and could be used to predict muscle mass and rate of muscle loss with 98% and 82% accuracy, respectively. Urinary metabolites related to muscle mass and muscle loss were associated with amino acid and ATP synthesis.
Overall, transcriptomics work revealed a molecular signature for low muscle attenuation, which parallels many gene expression changes observed during aberrant muscle repair and metabolic syndrome. This explorative transcriptomic study provides multiple potentially crucial pathways that have yet to be studied in detail in cachexia. Metabolomics work revealed that urine metabolites are most reflective of muscle mass and its change. This work suggests that it may be possible to develop a metabolomics-based tool to assess skeletal muscle mass in cancer. Validation of urine metabolomics to predict muscle mass loss is warranted.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study examined if nutrient loading of phosphorus-rich pollen into small mountain lakes has a significant impact on lake productivity. Increased pollen input into lakes due to changes in vegetation (e.g., timberline advance) may increase lake production. Deteriorated pollen was recorded for frozen and freeze-dried sediment samples to determine if storage method effects pollen preservation. There were no strong relationships between pollen accumulation rates (PAR) and pigment concentrations for Sentinel Lake and Eiffel Lake. A lagged response of pigment concentrations to increased PAR was illustrated for Eiffel. Examination of pollen ratios and stomata suggests recent timberline advance for Eiffel, but pollen ratios were a poor indicator of timberline for Sentinel. Sediment storage methods did not play a significant role in differential preservation of pollen grains. Further investigation of the potential effect of PAR on lake productivity is required because timberline advance may alter lake productivity through increased pollen input.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are composed of a broad family of tumours that develop from neuroendocrine cells dispersed throughout the body. The most common of which are carcinoid and pancreatic NETs. While NETs are relatively rare, the estimated incidence of NETs in the United States is increasing since the 1970s. Prognosis following complete surgical resection for local-regional disease is quite favorable. However, most patients present with metastatic disease making curative resection unlikely. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options in the setting of metastatic disease. NETs are highly vascular and angiogenesis plays an important role in tumour progression. Platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor (PDGF/PDGFR) is a class of growth factors which plays a significant role in angiogenesis. However, its role in NETs is not completely understood. The purpose of our study was to: i) assess the expression of PDGFR-α in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cell lines BON-1 and QGP-1 as well as in clinical specimens, ii) to determine the effect of PDGFR-α expression on cell migration and proliferation, and iii) to determine the effect of PDGFR-α expression on tumor growth in mouse xenograft model. We found that, although PDGFR-α is expressed on clinical specimens, neither BON-1 nor QGP-1 cell line express PDGFR-α. Therefore, stable BON-1 and QGP-1 constructs with inducible PDGFR-α expression were established to characterize its role in promoting tumour metastasis in NETs. The activation of PDGFR-α in BON-1 enhanced its migratory potential and the transformed phenotype can be reversed by selective PDGFR-α blockade. For both BON-1 and QGP-1, PDGFR-α expression increased tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Based on our results, tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target PDGFR, specifically the α-subunit, may be better suited to treating NETs.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life worldwide.  The intake of a heart-healthy diet is influenced by social norms, cultural values and beliefs, and economic constraints.  The effects of these factors in the context of low socioeconomic status (SES) populations with CVD are largely unknown.  Underpinned by critical realism, this study explored barriers to and facilitators of dietary intake of people with low SES status who received education at two cardiac facilities in Karachi, Pakistan.  Twenty-four male and female participants were interviewed.  This qualitative study employed the methodological genre of interpretive description.  ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software was used to analyse the participants’ interview data.
	The analysis revealed that food choices are characterized by multiple embedded meanings attached to the participants’ lives. Food is a means of communicating, socialising, expressing culture, and reflecting family and religious values.  People of low –SES face multiple challenges such as limited purchasing capacity, lack of transportation, and limited accessibility of healthy food.  Other barriers to healthy diets include the lack of food and security, the need to fulfil other responsibilities with scarce resources, and the lower priority of food choice.  Prescribed gender roles and lack of women’s autonomy and power, their inequity, male domination and abusive behaviours, and the greater importance of patriarchal and social norms also increase the CVD risk of female participants. Cardiovascular disease in Pakistanis of low SES will undoubtedly continue to escalate if individual and structural barriers are not reduced by using multifactorial approaches.
	Four publishable papers are presented in this dissertation.  The first focuses on CVD burden and risk-reduction strategies in Pakistan.  The second is the proposal for the study, and the third and fourth papers address the factors that influence dietary change and positive food choices of low-income people with CVD in Pakistan, including the influence of gender/sex role in CVD risk reduction. This research received a prestigious International Development Research Centre doctoral award from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada, and was extensively peer reviewed by a panel of independent experts in the field.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have created the opportunity for low cost aerial monitoring. As much of this development is not tailored for remote sensing applications, a custom built UAS was used to test the feasibility of inexpensive monitoring over forested and farmland case studies. This system flew autonomously at 50 m altitude above ground level, to create visual wavelength maps with 3 cm resolution and better than 5 m horizontal accuracy. Images were collected with 2 m spot size point spectrometer readings at 4 Hz, for identification of specific compounds. In test runs, approximately 15 acres were surveyed in just over 9 minutes. Methods developed can be applied to industrial monitoring applications such as tailings pond surface moisture content estimation and petroleum leak detection for pipelines.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Analysis of protein structures may reveal their function, regulation and interactions. Almost 90% of the known protein structures were solved using X-ray crystallography; however, many more structures remain unsolved. Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) project was created to speed up structure determination. PSI includes structural genomics (SG) centers that perform high-throughput crystallization which processes hundreds of proteins using standardized protocols. Large quantities of crystallization data generated by PSI fueled research that looked into proteins’ properties associated with success of crystallization. In spite of intense research crystallization of proteins is still among the most complex and least understood problems in structural biology. Since SG centers do not focus on individual proteins, but rather on covering the protein structure space, they have certain flexibility in selection of targets. At the beginning of my PhD program we designed and assessed three accurate methods that predict crystallization propensity based on a protein sequence. These methods could be used to prioritize targets based on their predicted propensity for the successful structure determination. We observed that as the crystallization protocols are updated the predictors of crystallization propensity need to be correspondingly upgraded and enhanced. To this end, in the course of the thesis we developed an accurate predictor that generates crystallization propensity and indicates causes of the potential crystallization failure, which can occur at any of the three major steps in the protein crystallization protocol: production of protein material, purification, and production of crystals. Our predictors are empirically compared against state-of-the-art in the field demonstrating favorable predictive performance. Finally, we designed another accurate and runtime-efficient method which we then used to perform first-of-its-kind large-scale analysis of crystallization propensity for proteins encoded in 1,953 fully sequenced genomes. Analysis of these predictions shows that current X-ray crystallography combined with homology modeling could provide an average per-proteome structural coverage of 73% with over 60% coverage for archaea and bacterial proteomes, and between 35 and 70% for eukaryotes. Moreover, our study revealed that use of knowledge-based target selection increases coverage by a significant margin, which for majority of organisms is between 25 to 40%.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Clients with cybersex addiction (CSA) are a growing challenge for mental health practitioners.  Therapists must be more skilled and adept at identifying when the core issue is cybersex addiction in spite of client denial and potentially confounding symptoms.  The main purpose of this exploratory research was to determine whether psychologists can identify when the presenting problem is cybersex addiction among non-disclosing clients.  A pilot was conducted with 10 doctoral-level graduate students in psychology and three Expert Validators to evaluate the construct validity and internal reliability of the Client Vignette Scoring Instrument (CVSI) created for this study.  The CVSI provided participants with three fictional case vignettes which each incorporated a specific number of CSA criteria.  The case of “Jeff” included no CSA symptoms, “Sophie” included the minimum required for diagnosis, and “Bill” included the maximum.  Psychologists were then recruited via the CPA and the PAA online and by mail, resulting in a final sample of 93 participants.  Three surveys were administered: the CVSI, a Modified Sexual Opinion Survey-Revised (SOS-R-M), and a demographic survey.  Alpha was set at .10.  Results of a chi-square test for goodness of fit indicated that a significant proportion of psychologists missed correctly identifying CSA as the primary presenting problem in the case of both Sophie and Bill, but correctly avoided identifying CSA as the primary presenting problem in the case of Jeff.  Results of a multiple linear regression found no significant predictive model in any of the three cases for the IVs age, number of years in practice, Internet familiarity, sexual attitude and amount of training in CSA/SA on the outcome variable perception of CSA symptoms.  Neither age, sexual attitude, gender, nor province of registration had a significant effect on perception of CSA symptoms in any of the cases.  Doctoral level psychologists had significantly lower scores on the outcome variable than Master's level in all cases.  Implications of the findings are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This work discusses the complexity of Mikhail Bulgakov’s novel The Master and Margarita. It investigates the challenges encountered when translating the novel into a different language as well as into a different medium. The first part of the thesis briefly examines the history of creation of the novel, as well as an overview of the most popular translations. Through comparative analysis of the original text with its English variants the thesis then demonstrates how Bulgakov’s messages were communicated. The methodological framework is based on the works by Jean-Paul Vinay and Jean Darbelnet, Eugene Nida, Antoine Berman and others. Through close reading and its comparison to cinematic adaptation, the thesis analyzes how Bulgakov’s messages were rendered into a different medium. Theoretical works by Patrice Pavis, Linda Hutcheon, Robert Stam and others serve as a foundation for this analysis and reveal the changes in approach towards adaptation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The numerical evaluation of challenging integrals is a topic of interest in applied mathematics. We investigate molecular integrals in the B function basis, an exponentially decaying basis with a compact analytical Fourier transform. The Fourier property allows analytical expressions for molecular integrals to be formulated in terms of semi-infinite highly oscillatory integrals with limited exponential decay. The semi-infinite integral representations in terms of nonphysical variables stand as the bottleneck in the calculation.

To begin our numerical experiments, we conduct a comparative study of the most popular numerical steepest descent methods, extrapolation methods and sequence transformations for computing semi-infinite integrals. It concludes that having asymptotic series representations for integrals and applying sequence transformations leads to the most efficient algorithms.

For three-center nuclear attraction integrals, we find an analytical expression for the semi-infinite integrals. Numerical experiments show the resulting algorithm is approximately 300 times more efficient than the state-of-the-art. For the four-center two-electron Coulomb integrals, we take a different approach. The integrand has singularities in the complex plane that can be near the path of integration, making standard quadrature routines unreliable. The trapezoidal rule with double exponential variable transformations has been shown to have very promising properties as a general-purpose integrator. We investigate the use of conformal maps to maximize the convergence rate, resulting in a nonlinear program for the optimized variable transformation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis describes experiments designed to investigate how motor units in tibialis anterior (TA) were recruited when electrical stimulation was applied over the TA muscle belly versus the common peroneal nerve trunk. The data from the first study (Chapter 2) showed that contractions were generated predominantly by depolarizing motor axons, regardless of stimulation site. The second study (Chapter 3) showed that single pulses of stimulation delivered over the muscle belly recruited motor units from superficial to deep as stimulation amplitude increased, but single pulses delivered over the nerve trunk recruited motor units evenly throughout the muscle, regardless of stimulus amplitude. Contrary to the results of Chapter 3, the final study (Chapter 4) provided preliminary evidence to suggest that repetitive stimulation recruited motor units from superficial to deep, regardless of stimulation site. In general, these findings support the idea that where electrical stimulation is delivered markedly affects how contractions are generated.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The purpose of this study was to advance the discussion of collaboration between Canadian sport organizations beyond current levels of critical rhetoric and to (a) recommend improvements to the collaborative sport management processes specifically related to this particular case and (b) provide an analytical framework that will facilitate the application of this knowledge to others in similar interorganizational relationships. 
The purpose was achieved by collecting empirical evidence on the collaborative process through a theoretically guided case study of the relationship between Sport Canada and Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), which were selected for the study due to their prominence in the Canadian sport system. Agency theory was chosen to provide the primary guiding framework for development of the research questions, and data collection and analysis. Data collection included three sources: my personal narrative, a selection of relevant documents, and personal interviews with thirteen key informants familiar with the two sport organizations. Data analysis was guided by the key concepts of agency theory to provide structure for the process. 
Consistent with the assumptions of agency theory, my findings indicated that the primary goals of Sport Canada and CIS are incongruent and that a managed contract is in place that includes financial incentives for CIS to collaborate with  Sport Canada, but the incentives do not appear to work. Reporting and monitoring occur on an annual basis, but the relationship is essentially one of funding and accountability and not collaboration.
The results of this research suggest that the current paradigmatic approach to understanding the Canadian sport system, based on the assumption that the federal government controls funding and national policy and thereby controls the sport system,  is inappropriate and works directly against the espoused need for interorganizational collaboration. The opportunity for enhanced collaboration does exist, but intentional efforts to collaborate must be increased. The control paradigm should be rejected in favor of shared goal setting and decision-making and a negotiated contract between the organizations that identifies a measurable collaborative advantage. 
This research confirmed and explained the contribution that can be made by agency theory to the study and management of collaboration in sport organizations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a technology that efficiently and economically score written responses by emulating intelligence of human scorer. Present study had employed open-source Natural Language Processing technologies for developing AES framework, to score multilingual medical licensing examination. English, French, and translated-French responses of constructed-response items were scored automatically, and the strength of multilingual automated scoring framework were evaluated in relation to human scoring. Machine-translation was also contextualized for raising AES performance, when restricted sample size counters the performance of AES software. Specific feature extraction and model building strategies resulted in high concordance between AES and human scoring, with average maximum human-machine accuracy of 95.7%, which was in almost perfect agreement with human markers. Results also revealed that the machine-translator had raised predictive consistency but negatively influenced the predictive accuracy. Implications of results for practice, as well as directions for future research are also presented.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The research in this dissertation develops a multiperspective theoretical framework, which I describe as queer criticality, to guide the examination of discursive practices, educational policies, and public discourses that undergird heteronormativity and disproportionately impact the personal safety and professional wellbeing of sexual minority and gender variant (SMGV) teachers and students in Canadian K-12 schools. Queer criticality, as a theoretical construct, seeks to bring together and investigate aspects of critical theory, critical pedagogy, poststructuralism, and queer theory. My aim is not to attempt to reconcile these competing theories to produce a grand narrative or proscriptive way of theorizing; rather, I investigate the productive tensions that a notion of queer criticality can prompt for self-reflexive researchers when these theoretical perspectives are placed in dynamic relationship with one another. Accordingly, this collection of interwoven essays examine critically how research has positioned SMGV youth as both victims and, more recently, resilient survivors who experience a daily onslaught of homophobic, transphobic, and heterosexist violence in their schools, classrooms, and communities; it also explores interpretative frameworks and mobilization strategies used to politicize or privatize SMGV identities and concerns through educational policy and practice; and it utilizes empirical research to interrogate the lived effects of these heteronormative discourses and discursive practices on sexual minority teachers working for inclusive educational and social change; and transsexual teachers searching for a valued space and place for recognition of their personal and professional identities in their public schools. Ultimately, through these connected essays, this poststructural assemblage seeks to open up spaces for difference to be exposed and interrogated within K-12 public schools. It also works to help provide discursive materiality to sexual minority and gender variant identities by demonstrating how heteronormalizing discourses impact and shape the lived experiences of all teachers and students in Canadian schools. Ultimately, this research asks whose lives are deemed intelligible and, thus, liveable in our public schools.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The utilization of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) as a potential
material characterization technique has been demonstrated through academic
and industrial research in past. LIBS has been applied for lateral surface
scanning of materials and in depth resolution analysis. The necessity of improving
lateral and depth resolution has led to the the development of microLIBS,
a regime using low energy microjoule laser pulses. Femtosecond lasers have
advanced the technique by its ability to produce high finer micromachined features.
The optimization of pulse energy, optics, detectors and experimental
environments are required to obtain precise surface microanalysis using LIBS.
This thesis has been focused on a number of essential aspects of LIBS microanalysis.
Laser ablation characteristics of materials depend on laser parameters
and material properties. The single shot ablation threshold of chromium
has been determined using UV femtosecond laser pulses and compared with
two temperature model (TTM) predictions. The spatio-temporal evolution of
the femtosecond laser induced micro-plasma plumes were characterized in the
nanojoule ablation regime. The plume splitting, angular distribution of the
plumes, plume lengths and plume images at threshold energies were characterized.
Analytical models were used to compare plasma plume expansion and propagation characteristics. A LIBS depth profiling technique has been studied
together with deep blind hole drilling using femtosecond laser pulses. The
material removal rates were measured and compared with analytical calculations.
The depth sensitive region that contributes to the LIBS emission has
been evaluated for a single shot depth profiling study. It has been demonstrated
by experiment and TTM model calculations that the depth sensitive
region is much smaller than the ablated crater depth. Thin chromium lines
on silicon wafers were prepared and scanning microanalysis across these metal
strips using UV femtosecond pulses were carried out. Lateral resolution of the
order of a micron has been obtained using LIBS.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Froth flotation is one of the most common methods in the mineral industry for selective extraction of a small fraction of desired mineral from a finely mixed ground ore. 
This work explores the development of a fundamental dynamic model for froth flotation with parameters of the model being estimated and updated online with applicable techniques such as extended Kalman filtering. In the first step, a fundamental dynamic model was proposed and then a series of flotation experiments in a JK Tech batch flotation cell were designed and performed by the Fractional Factorial Design method. In the second step, the developed model was reconciled with dynamic data from the batch flotation cell, and model parameters were estimated and updated on-line using extended Kalman filtering.
Results show the applicability of the Kalman filter estimator for tracking changes in operational conditions and in parameter estimation when disturbances were applied to the system.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis presents an investigation of macro-scale (&gt;5mm) multi-wavelength acoustophoresis. This is a technique used for the filtration of micro-particles from the containing suspension. It uses the primary acoustic force generated by an ultrasonic acoustic pressure standing wave. Primary acoustic force is isolated in different multi-wavelength acoustic separator experiments and imaging methods are used to capture the motion of particles separating from the containing fluid. Different investigation methods and models for analyzing the macro-scale acoustic resonators are developed and the experimented acoustic resonators are characterized.
A particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) approach for measuring individual particle motion is developed specifically to track particles over the lifetime of their motion as they densify to an acoustic pressure node. The applicability of primary acoustic force theory to the macro-scale acoustic resonators is validated by applying the PTV method to images of densification of mono-disperse size and poly-dispersed size particles. Utilizing the developed validated PTV method, the acoustic energy density, a parameter that can only be derived from experiments is also determined. A probability density function (PDF) modeling the location of particles for determination of acoustic energy density is also developed which is in agreement with the PTV method.
The influence of dampening and scattering of the acoustic wave in macro-scale multi-wavelength is studied. This is performed by variation of piezo-electric transducer (PZT) voltage and changing the viscosity of the suspension by using different solutions of glycerol in water. The resulting acoustic energy density dependence on PZT voltage in macro-scale multi-wavelength acoustic resonators is observed to be different from that of micro-scale acoustic resonators. This effect, which is visible in all different experimented suspensions, indicates that macro-scale multi-wavelength acoustic resonators inherently show more dampening effects than micro-scale acoustic resonators.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Over the past two decades, wireless networking has become an enabling technology for ubiquitous computing and inexpensive Internet access. The demand for wireless networking has also increased steadily, including a wider range of applications, larger user populations, and larger network scale. Challenges come from the increasing variety of traffic (such as data, voice and video), service criteria (e.g. QoS/QoE, reliability, security etc.), as well as system requirements (e.g. revenue, fairness, aggregate network performance etc.). Furthermore, wireless networks are less stable, tractable and predictable compared with wired environments, due to physical and management realities. From the physical perspective, the time-varying soft capacity of wireless channels, as well as co-channel and adjacent-channel interference degrades transmission quality and reduces their effective capacity. From the management perspective, uncontrolled resource competition and uneven resource distribution degrades network performance. Although hardware advances are critical to satisfy ever-growing user demands, the efficiency of resource management plays an equally (if not more) important role to push wireless networking to its full potential in terms of satisfying diverse user and system requirements. In this thesis, we propose an effective framework of resource management to reduce the gap between diverse user/system demands and limited delivery capability of wireless networks. Our simulation results demonstrate that this proposed framework of resource management achieves the lowest packet loss rate, best end-to-end delay and fairness without compromising network throughput, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach is simple in computation and light in overhead.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A surrogate spinal cord was developed to test the mechanical stability of electrode
arrays for intraspinal implants. The mechanical and surface properties of
candidate materials were tested. The elastic modulus was characterized using
dynamic mechanical analysis. Forces required to indent the surrogate cords to
specified depths was measured. Frictional forces were measured by pulling a
needle out at a controlled rate. The results were compared to actual spinal cords,
either to value from literature or ex vivo measurements. Surrogate cords with the
most suitable properties (formaldehyde crosslinked gelatin, 12 wt% in water)
were implanted with two types of intraspinal electrode arrays (one made of
individual microwires and another of microwires anchored with a solid base), and
an elongation was applied. Arrays with solid bases impeded the deformation of
the cord suggesting that they could cause tissue damage in vivo, while arrays
without a base moved freely with the cord.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Mackenzie Delta region, NWT, has a short growing season and highly seasonal climate, and brown bears (Ursus arctos) there face many challenges obtaining their nutritional requirements. Consumption of meat by brown bears is linked to increases in population density, fecundity, growth and body size. I examined the use of Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii), and broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) as meat sources by Mackenzie Delta brown bears. As a preliminary step, I built an Arctic ground squirrel habitat model, using field-surveyed ground squirrel burrow locations. Using this model, I examined bears’ selection for Arctic ground squirrel habitat as a population, by sex and as individuals, and linked this to results of stable isotope analysis and site investigations. Bears showed little evidence of Arctic ground squirrel use at the population and sex level, but some individual bears appeared to prey heavily on ground squirrels, particularly during hyperphagia. I also described observations of a brown bear using broad whitefish in autumn, and used telemetry locations to show that other bears may also feed heavily on broad whitefish during hyperphagia. My research provides prey-specific evidence for intrapopulation niche variation among Mackenzie Delta brown bears.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Phase transitions of the alkali metal carboxylates have been explored by many researchers. A fair amount of scatter can also be observed in the published data. The aim of this study was to systematically study the thermal behavior of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium and rubidium carboxylates, although only lithium, sodium and potassium carboxylates are industrially relevant.The success of the synthesis and purification of the carboxylates were confirmed by the infrared spectroscopy. The carboxylates were pure enough for further thermal study. Thermal analyses were performed using the cryogenic differential scanning calorimeter and the thermogravimetric analyzer. The nature of transition phases were investigated by microscopic differential scanning calorimeter. A critical evaluation of the present data in relation to literature values is included.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis, experiments that investigated the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) parameters on corticospinal (CS) excitability are described.  The NMES-induced afferent volley can increase CS excitability, which can facilitate neurorehabilitation.  However, literature outlining the optimal NMES parameters for increasing CS excitability is limited.  In the first project, we found that functional electrical stimulation (NMES with high stimulus intensity and frequency) increased CS excitability, while somatosensory stimulation (NMES with low stimulus intensity and frequency) did not.  In the second project, longer pulse durations increased the magnitude of H-reflexes from tibialis anterior, but we found no difference in their effects on CS excitability between pulse durations.  These results provide insight for which parameters of NMES best increase CS excitability.  Improvements in function resulting from NMES are attributed to the NMES-induced increases in CS excitability, thus identifying how to best increase CS excitability may be important for rehabilitative applications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The government of Canada initiated, implemented, and officially maintained the ‘Eskimo Identification Canada’ system from 1941-1971. With the exception of the Labrador Inuit, who formed the Labrador Treaty of 1765 in what is now called, NunatuKavat, all other Canadian Inuit peoples were issued a leather-like necklace with a numbered fibre-cloth disk. These stringed identifiers attempted to replace Inuit names, tradition, individuality, and indigenous distinctiveness.
This was the Canadian governments’ attempt to exert a form of state surveillance and its official authority, over its own Inuit citizenry. The Eskimo Identification Canada system, E-number, or disk system eventually became entrenched within Inuit society, and in time it became a form of identification amongst the Inuit themselves.
What has never been examined by an Inuk researcher, or student is the long-lasting affect these numbered disks had upon the Inuit, and the continued impact into present-day, of this type of state-operated system. The Inuit voice has not been heard or examined. This research focuses exclusively on the disk system itself and brings forward the voices of four disk system survivors, giving voice to those who have been silenced for far too long.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The nutritional value of biodiesel co-products were studied for swine. In Exp. 1, expeller-pressed canola meal was nutritionally characterized and validated for grower-finisher pigs. Expeller-pressed canola meal provided adequate energy and AA; ADG was reduced 3 g/d per 1% expeller-pressed canola meal inclusion in diets formulated to equal NE and SID AA, due to 5 µmol/g dietary glucosinolates. In Exp. 2, cold-pressed canola cake samples from 4 different processing conditions were tested against expeller-pressed canola meal and seed in a digestibility study. Higher residual oil in the cake increased the DE and NE content. In Exp. 3, 15% of either solvent-extracted or expeller-pressed canola meal with or without 5% glycerol was tested against a soybean meal diet for weanlings. Solvent-extracted or expeller-pressed canola meal, or in combination with 5% glycerol can partially replace soybean meal in weaner diets formulated to equal NE and SID AA content without affecting growth performance.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The use of simulation is becoming increasingly important in the education of practitioners whose field of work contains a low tolerance for error. In aerospace, aviation, medicine, paramedicine, and the military, simulations are expected to provide working practitioners with “on demand” experience. However, the ways in which learning emerges out of simulation have been poorly understood. This research provides insight into the processes of learning that are generated and the forms of knowledge that arise out of learning endeavors based upon the use of simulation. 
This study employed a form of naturalistic inquiry. Eight individuals from seven domains of work were extensively interviewed regarding their simulation experience. Conceptually, the methods are premised upon Patton’s (2002) understanding of qualitative inquiry, Van Manen’s (1997) phenomenological approach to lived experience, and Ricoeur’s hermeneutical approach to the interpretation of the text. Ricoeur’s (1986) conceptualization of ideology and utopia as a dialectic which comprises the social imaginary and Kearney’s (2003) analysis of the Other inform the analysis.
It is the central finding of this study that experience in simulation is consistently interpreted to be both real and an imagination of the real. Experiential learning has at least five dimensions: purpose, interpretation, engagement, self, and context (Fenwick, 2003) all of which are affected in the pedagogical activity of simulation. The learning that emerges out of simulation always involves the social imaginary. Simulation forces an engagement with the symbolic nature of the social imaginary, and it is because a specific aspect of the social imaginary is reproduced in simulation that a need for interpretation is provoked and learning occurs. 
This study is theoretically significant because it adds to the academic literature through an improved understanding of simulation as a complex entanglement of the real and the imaginary. Practical significance lies in understanding the effective use of simulation as a pedagogical tool which can inform or reify the existing dimensions of experiential learning. Overall, the study contributes to our knowledge about how learning emerges out of simulation and how simulation fosters such an emergence.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis addresses the suitability of current museum websites for supporting the research activities of academic scholars. Over the past few decades, cultural heritage institutions have increasingly made their collections available online, but longstanding issues with the completeness and consistency of their records have resulted in resources of questionable usefulness. In addition, the museum studies community has chronically ignored scholars as a user group worthy of consideration, and there is thus no existing information on what this population expects and needs from digital collections. Focusing on doctorate holders who study Classical antiquities, this research demonstrates how significant academics are as an audience of the websites created by these organizations, and examines what information and functionality the group requires from these resources in contrast with what museums are actually providing. An online survey of twenty-five faculty members at seven major Canadian universities was conducted to provide a preliminary model of an ideal online collection. Based on this theoretical prototype, the websites of ten North American museums were then assessed to determine how well they are meeting the needs of scholars. The results of both studies were used to devise a set of recommended areas on which new digital collections should focus, and which existing resources should prioritize for improvement. Some of the key problems uncovered include the quantity, detail, and consistency of metadata, the number and content of photographs, the limited options for locating and identifying objects of interest, and the poor provisions for comparing artefacts. This research is limited in scope and addresses only a small portion of a large issue, but the results offer a foundation on which future studies might build.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: We report here that knockdown of either amyloid precursor protein (APP) or prion protein (PrP) in the zebrafish produces an overt dose-dependent phenotype characterized by systemic morphological defects and CNS cell death. We report findings that the zebrafish PrP-1 gene genetically interacts with one, but not the other, zebrafish APP gene paralog. The interaction proves specific to these genes and human and mouse mRNAs can rescue the observed phenotypes, highlighting conserved functions. We find apoptotic labeling increased and aggregating ability of cells decreased when either of these genes is substantially knocked down, or sub-effective knock down of each gene is combined. Using a cell mixing paradigm we further provide evidence that the interaction occurs in a cell autonomous fashion. Our study is the first to report an in vivo interaction between these two genes, which could prove invaluable to the design and screening of therapeutics.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: While extensive research has been done on technology-mediated learning (TML) in North America, such research is not easily transferable to the Caribbean, as there are notable socio-cultural and economic factors that affect such methods of course delivery. Limited research has been recorded about TML within a Caribbean context. This study employed a qualitative research methodology to gain an understanding of the individual and collective experiences of Jamaican educators who are using technology-mediated learning within the classroom. The methodology employed solicited the participation of one group of educators for this research. The two approaches that were used to collect data were group interviews and one-on-one interviews. The findings revealed that while faculty were keen on leveraging the available technology, there were still faculty, student and institutional challenges that were being encountered, ultimately affecting the effectiveness of the technology used to complement the teaching and learning process.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: To ensure oil sands process water (OSPW) is suitable for discharge into the environment, advanced water treatment technologies are required. In this study, integrated ozonation-biodegradation was investigated as a potential treatment option for OSPW. The treatment efficiency was evaluated in terms of naphthenic acid (NA) degradation, chemical oxygen demand (COD), carbonaceous Biological oxygen demand (CBOD), and acute toxicity reduction. Degradation of NAs of more than 99% was achieved using a semi-batch ozonation system at a utilized ozone dose of 80 mg/L combined with subsequent biodegradation. The results also show that ozone decreased the amount of COD while increasing the biodegradability of COD. It was noted that the carbon number and number of NA rings influenced the level of NA oxidation. With a utilized ozone dose of approximately 100 mg/L, the ozonated and biodegraded treated OSPW showed no toxic effect towards bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The results of this study indicate that integrated ozonation-biodegradation is a promising treatment technology for OSPW.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: Nursing is a practice discipline and patients expect nurses will use the best evidence available to improve outcomes. A major challenge to the implementation of best practice is the complexity of organizational and social environments in which nurses’ work. One method to keep nurses informed of best practice is to employ change agents; nurses with clinical expertise and familiarity with research who can transfer the evidence to those in clinical settings. It has been suggested that the clinical nurse specialist (CNS), as an educator, consultant, clinical expert, researcher, and leader is well situated to promote evidence-based practice in the workplace. 
Purpose: The purpose of this explanatory mixed methods study is to gain a deeper understanding of the CNS role, as it pertains to promoting evidence-based practice. The research question guiding this research is: What is the role of the CNS in promoting evidence-based practice in acute care and community settings in Saskatchewan? 
Methods: This study used Creswell and Plano Clark’s sequential explanatory mixed methods design that focused on an initial collection and analysis of 
quantitative data followed by a collection and analysis of qualitative data. The survey data was analyzed using SPSS 18. The transcribed interviews were reviewed for recurrent themes regarding the CNSs’ role in promoting evidence-based practice. The PARiHS framework provided the broad structure to identify themes. Interpretive description was used to analyze the themes.
Findings: To carry out their role as facilitators of EBP, CNSs rely on their: master’s preparation, clinical expertise, and people/communication skills. In order to streamline processes to increase efficiencies, share their expert knowledge with staff and patients, and provide leadership, CNSs need to work in supportive contexts and have access to high quality evidence. The primary source of written evidence used by CNSs was the internet at work and the primary source of “people” evidence was the CNS’s personal experience. Lack of role clarity and leadership were barriers to carrying out their roles in an effective manner.
Conclusion: CNSs can improve patient outcomes by using best evidence in the provision of care, but to do so, they need to work in supportive contexts.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The impact of mixing on diluted bitumen de-watering is studied in two stages using a fractional factorial design of experiments. The first stage evaluates the relative effects of bulk demulsifier dosage, local maximum energy dissipation, and mixing time. The second stage of experiments evaluates the relative effects of bulk demulsifier dosage, local maximum energy dissipation, mixing time, and the injection concentration of the demulsifier. Shaker table results did not compare well with results obtained using a stirred tank. A shear and sedimentation test cell (SSTC) is designed to conduct mixing and settling in the same vessel while providing a large ratio of impeller volume to tank volume. The bulk concentration of demulsifier is the dominant effect, but favourable levels of local maximum energy dissipation, mixing time, and injection concentration are necessary to optimize demulsifier performance. Solids removal is shown to be a function of water removal.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The mining of oil sands ore and extraction of bitumen produces aqueous slurries containing bitumen, coarse sand and fine clays. The performance of key process units is highly dependent on the rheology of “carrier fluid”, which is comprised of the fine solids and water. Although viscosity is important in process design and monitoring, it is rarely measured and instead determined using correlations. Viscosity depends on numerous factors including fines concentration, solids mineralogy and water chemistry - properties reflected in the size of aggregates formed by agglomerating solid species. More accurate correlations could be obtained by using additional correlating parameters. In this project rheology measurements were obtained using a concentric cylinder rheometer and compared with fines and aggregate volume fractions determined from particle image analysis. Multiple linear regression of key variables provided an equation to predict viscosity using fines content and calcium ion concentration as correlating parameters.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Inductors are extensively used in the design of radio-frequency circuits. In the last decade, the integration of passive components, especially inductors on silicon chips, has led to the widespread development and implementation of Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs) in CMOS technologies. However, on-chip passive inductors occupy a large silicon chip area and hardly scale down with technology scaling. Therefore, on-chip passive inductors become formidable obstacles to the realization of highly dense RFICs to be integrated with other highly dense digital circuits on a single chip using a common fabrication process. In recent years, researchers have focused on replacing passive inductors with transistor-only active circuits, namely active inductors. Active inductors can be realized with only a few transistors, which scale down with technology scaling. Therefore, they occupy a fraction of the chip area of their passive counterparts, and can be implemented densely in CMOS processes. Unlike passive inductors, bias dependent operations of active inductors allow for the tuning of their inductance and quality factor Q, and in turn, tuning the performance parameters of RFICs.

This thesis focuses on the design and development of passive inductorless CMOS RFICs for ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver front-ends using active inductors. A new Q-enhanced and a new bandwidth-extended tunable active inductors are designed. Using the Q-enhanced active inductor, two tunable UWB low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) (two-stage and three-stage UWB LNAs), a UWB mixer and a wideband local-oscillator (LO) driver are designed. Active inductors are utilized to develop a novel wideband active shunt-peaking technique that decreases high-frequency losses to yield a flat gain over a wide bandwidth. A tunable multiband-UWB front-end integrating a two-stage UWB LNA, and a pair of UWB mixers driven by a pair of wideband LO drivers, is fabricated in a 90nm digital CMOS process. The passive inductorless two-stage UWB LNA, three-stage UWB LNA and UWB front-end occupy chip areas of only 0.0114mm2, 0.0227mm2, and 0.1485mm2, respectively. The active CMOS UWB front-end exhibits a measured flat gain of 22.5dB over 2.5-8.8 GHz bandwidth, and its tunability allows for varying the gain and bandwidth.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis investigates the status of Mathematical Induction (MI) in an axiomatic system. It first reviews and analyses the status of MI in the works of Gotlob Frege and Richard Dedekind, the pioneers of logicism who, in providing foundations for arithmetic, attempted to reduce MI to what they considered logic to be. These analyses reveal that their accounts of MI have the same structure and produce the same result. This is true even though the two thinkers used different components as fundamental logical elements and went through different routes to eventually prove (on the basis of more fundamental logical axioms and rules of inference and definitions) what they considered MI to be. Based on these analyses, we infer a formulation, i.e., U-MI, that presents both Frege’s and Dedekind’s formulations of MI. 

We then evaluate the possible proof- and model-theoretic problems that such a formulation of MI faces. These problems, among others, include certain difficulties with U-MI as a representation of mathematical induction, the problem of impredicativity, and the unattainability of the infinitary nature of MI in a finitary logic. We then introduce and defend our own account of the status of MI in an axiomatic system, in which MI is axiomatizable/derivable in an infinitary many-sorted logic. The final part of the study investigates concerns with the metatheoretical use of MI – in particular the circularity problem in such a use. Within this last part, we also explicate and elaborate on one of the advantages of our account of the status of MI in an axiomatic system in comparison to the rival accounts.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In the Rocky Mountain foothills of Alberta, Canada, activities of the forestry and energy sectors have resulted in the installation of tens of thousands of stream-crossing
structures. In fifteen Athabasca River basins I found that culverts impeded upstream movements of non-sportfish species relative to reference bridge sites. Conversely, abundances of Rainbow Trout significantly increased upstream of culverts. I suggest that culverts that exclude Burbot, a voracious predator, or high temperatures above culverts allow for increased productivity of Rainbow Trout. Water quality and substrate composition did not noticeably change upstream and downstream of bridges, while culverts had significantly higher water temperatures and silt/sand upstream. In evaluating the effectiveness and temporal biases of common sampling techniques, I found that backpack electrofishing and angling had the highest Arctic grayling detection probabilities. Angling detected larger juvenile and adult fish (&gt;110 mm), while young-of-the-year were more easily detected using backpack electrofishing in later summer.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study examined fairness in the online society of World of Warcraft(WoW), a society under constraint by game developers but dynamically affected by users. Because the society is voluntary, people have the ability to both effect
major change on, and leave, that society at any time. Thus, fairness in this virtual world is an important area for anthropological research. In-game fairness pointed
to the organization, distribution, and acquisition of wealth. In particular, I examined player perceptions of real-money trading (RMT) in the context of individual and collective motivations in the endgame. In addition, I considered loot distribution systems as a mode of promoting player-initiated definitions of fairness. I discovered an overall economy of fun in which players act to maximize
fun for the majority. Real-money trading was justified by casual players because players require progression as individuals in order to better serve the fun of the
collective.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis expands prior academic studies on the social context of Cantonese opera by analyzing its social functions and the role it plays in the Edmonton Chinese community from 1890 to 2009.  This study affirms the versatility of Cantonese opera as an art form that has been transmitted overseas and continued its presence and vibrancy throughout the history of Chinese immigration in Edmonton.  This study uncovers the social relevance of Cantonese opera in meeting changing community needs and in fortifying the changing Chinese self-identity from sojourners to settlers through three historical episodes.  As such, this study adds knowledge to understanding Chinese life experiences previously unexplored in Edmonton and contributes to the overall body of knowledge on prairie Chinese and on Cantonese opera in an overseas setting.  This study has implications for further research or comparative studies on the socio-cultural life of Chinese in Canada and cultural globalization.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is declining across its range due to disturbances such as mountain pine beetle and white pine blister rust. In this thesis, I assess the response and vulnerability of whitebark pine ecosystems to multiple stressors and disturbances at the northern edge of P.albicaulis’ range in the Coastal Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Both the compositional change over time of overstory and understory communities as well as vegetation spatial patterns suggest that different sites or ecosystem types housing whitebark pine may differ in their response to disturbance and stress. Surveys conducted ~ 20 years apart indicate that overstory community change differed between site types following the decline of P. albicaulis over time, while the understory did not change significantly. The spatial pattern of overstory species and understory communities also indicates that site type may be important in determining forest change under ongoing disturbance to whitebark pine.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The community of El Codito, an under-resourced Bogota community, has a high population density with the majority living under the poverty line. People with disabilities (PWD) and their caregivers in El Codito experience a lack of access to health information and are socially isolated. This community-based research project used SMS, on basic mobile phones, as a tool for information access and social interaction with 8 caregivers of PWD in El Codito. Using primarily qualitative methods, the research explored: 1) the experience of caregivers in the project, 2) the opinions and use of mobile phones and 3) sustainability considerations and constraints. Caregivers experienced the project as a window to possibility; the possibility of a social support network, the possibility of community participation and the possibility of change. The presence of mobile phone use in El Codito, and many under resourced communities, provides a feasible method for reducing the exclusion of PWD and caregivers.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Charles Taylor writes that identity emerges from the reflection upon, and articulation of one’s lived experience.  This account of identity precludes psychology from taking a natural science approach to the study of ‘identity’, or ‘the self’.  Psychology has emerged within secular society, and the relation between psychology and religion is examined here. This examination clarifies the role of psychology as an authority on identity. This thesis proposes that the role of psychology is to promote articulacy about the ideal of authenticity.  In this way, psychology can address problems arising from individualism in modernity, and can serve as an authority on identity, complementing the other possible authorities on identity present in secular society, including religion.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) consist of a group of pathologies affecting the masticatory muscles, the temporomandibular joint and related structures. The association between the cervical spine and TMD has been studied from different perspectives; however, the study of cervical muscles and their significance in the development and perpetuation of TMD has not been elucidated. Thus, this project was designed to investigate the association between cervical musculoskeletal impairments and TMD. A sample of subjects who attended the TMD/Orofacial Pain clinic, and students and staff at the University of Alberta participated in this study. All subjects underwent a series of physical tests and electromyographic assessment (i.e. head and neck posture, maximal cervical muscle strength, cervical flexor and extensor muscles endurance, and cervical flexor muscle performance) to determine cervical musculoskeletal impairments. All subjects were asked to complete the Neck disability Index and the Jaw Function Scale, and the Chronic Pain Grade Disability Questionnaire. A strong relationship between neck disability and jaw disability was found (r=0.82). Craniocervical posture (measured using the eye-tragus-horizontal angle) was statistically different between patients with myogenous TMD and healthy subjects. However, the difference was too small (3.3º) to be considered clinically relevant. Maximal cervical flexor muscle strength was not statistically or clinically different between patients with TMD and healthy subjects. No statistically significant differences were found in electromyographic activity of the sternocleidomastoid or the anterior scalene muscles in patients with TMD when compared to healthy subjects while executing the craniocervical flexion test (p=0.07). However, clinically important effect sizes (0.42-0.82) were found. Subjects with TMD presented with reduced cervical flexor as well as extensor muscle endurance while performing the flexor and extensor muscle endurance tests when compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with mixed TMD presented with steeper negative slopes (although modest) at several times during the neck extensor muscle endurance test than healthy subjects. The results of this research provided an important clinical contribution to the area of physical therapy and TMD. It identified impairments in the cervical spine in patients with TMD that could help guide clinicians in the assessment and prescription of more effective interventions for individuals with TMD.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis examines and compares printed and digital scholarly editions from three separate but complementary perspectives.  The overarching aim is to increase the understanding of the relative merits of printed and digital scholarly editions.  The perspectives employed include a theoretical one, in which scholarly editions are situated within the context of media theory; a comparative one, in which particular printed and digital editions are compared with each other; and another comparative one, in which particular digital editions are compared with each other.  
	The conclusion is that although digital scholarly editions offer new and exciting opportunities for research, printed ones also have advantages and are still useful for scholars.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study explores the history of the Gyro Club playground movement in Edmonton, Alberta, from the 1920s to the 1950s. Investigating who the Gyros were and how they structured play for children offers new insights to the history of Edmonton’s playground movement and social reform in civic development.  It probes how children experienced playgrounds and how the City built partnerships with a voluntary sector organization to promote recreation services through more than twenty years.
This work adds to understanding the implications of men’s leadership in urban social reform and in the child saving movement. It also presents children’s perspectives informed by archival and oral history sources on play in Gyro playgrounds.  Furthermore larger shifts were related to voluntary sector and public sector work in urban governance and the lives of citizens.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: My PhD thesis work is centered on developing a suitable approach to
account for solvent effects in solution spectroscopic measurements and on
providing significant insights into the intermolecular interactions between chiral
solute and solvent, in particular water, molecules. Vibrational absorption (VA)
and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic techniques have been
used as the main experimental tools to study conformational distributions and
most importantly solute-solvent interactions of a number of prototype chiral
molecules in several common solvents. The spectral window from 800 cm-1 to
1800 cm-1 was used for data acquisition. Aqueous solutions, both normal and
deuterated water, and organic solvents such as methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and
chloroform were used. Complementary optical rotatory dispersion measurements
have also been carried out. Density functional theory has been employed to
perform all calculations for conformational searches, geometry optimizations,
VA, VCD, UV, and ECD intensities, and spectral simulations. To account for
effects of water solvent, a clusters-in-a-liquid approach has been proposed.
Molecular dynamics simulations and radial distribution function calculations have
also been carried out to identify the representative hydration clusters, i.e. chiral
solute-(water)N. Initial conformational analyses have been done using small basis
set like 6-31G(d), which is a compromise between accuracy and computational
cost. For final calculations, several larger basis set like 6-31++G(d,p), 6-
311++G(d,p), cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ, have been used and the specific
choices depend on the size and complexity of systems under the investigation. Geometries of the molecular systems of interest have been evaluated in the gas
phase and in bulk solvent using the implicit solvation polarization continuum
model, while the related geometries of the explicit hydration clusters of the
targeted chiral molecules have been similarly evaluated. My thesis work shows
that inclusion of both explicit and implicit solvent effects simultaneously is
essential to interpret the experimental VA and VCD spectra whenever strong
hydrogen-bonding interactions are expected between chiral solute and solvent
molecules. When no strong solvent–solute hydrogen-bonding interactions are
expected, it was found that the gas phase monomer model is adequate but not
optimal for spectral interpretations and the inclusion of the implicit bulk water
environment is highly recommended.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Selecting the most appropriate cranes and identifying ideal crane locations on site can improve the productivity and safety of large-scale construction projects. A significant proportion of crane accidents have been caused by improper crane selection, lack of a proper crane support system, or a failure to calculate actual support reactions. This research presents a methodology to select feasible crane and optimize crane locations by evaluating the crane support reactions. This research seeks to provide practitioners with a methodology for successful crane operations through the utilization of decision support system. The developed system assists in proper crane selection, and also calculates the crane support reactions in order to design the support system. The proposed methodology optimizes the load moments for all lifted loads in order to identify the ideal crane location, which can in turn assist in selecting the most appropriate crane. Three case studies are described in order to demonstrate the use of the presented methodology for improving crane operations. This research aims to establish crane operational standardization for large projects involving multiple heavy lifts, such as modular building construction and Alberta Oil-Sands projects.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Blackleg, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, is one of the most damaging diseases of oilseed rape, Brassica napus. Interspecific hybridization between B. napus and B. carinata was done to transfer resistance to PG4 type blackleg pathotype from B. carinata into B. napus. In vitro ovule culture and in vivo seed set techniques were applied for the production of interspecific hybrids, where ovule culture was more efficient than in vivo seed set; and ovule culture in NN liquid medium was more efficient than B5 solid medium. All the interspecific F1 hybrids were resistant to blackleg. The F1 hybrids were recurrently backcrossed to B. napus and selection for cotyledon and adult plant resistance performed in each generation. In the backcross generations, significant number of seedlings with cotyledon resistance was found to be susceptible at the adult plant stage suggesting that cotyledon and adult plant resistance is under different genetic control in B. carinata. The proportion of resistant plants decreased with the progression of backcrossing- apparently due to loss of B. carinata chromosome(s) carrying the resistance.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Cost and schedule integration can improve efficiencies in construction planning and control since they are key constraints in project delivery and closely related. This research provides a framework for cost and schedule integration, and transforms the model to simulation-based planning in which the uncertainties of project cost and schedule are evaluated through computer simulation. This has been achieved through explicitly incorporating risk, resource, and detailed operation into a work-packaging model. The developed framework has been implemented in the Simphony.Net modeling environment as a special purpose simulation tool called ISP (integrated simulation-based planning). The ISP’s main framework is a simulation-based network analysis based on a precedence diagram method. The ISP tool application has been demonstrated with a hypothetical road construction project. The approach is useful for considering risks in the early stages of project planning for investigating a range of possible project completion times and cost estimates in multiple scenarios.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis presents techniques to measure the human arm's mechanical impedance using a rehabilitation robot, drawing applications to telerehabilitation and patient motor function assessment.

Conventional teleoperation system stability analysis and control assumes the human operator remains passive and injects no net energy into the system. The validity of this assumption is evaluated by mathematically analyzing the passivity of empirical arm impedance models. The results show that the arm is passive when relaxed but may become active when participants rigidly hold their arm in place. This non-passive behaviour originates from the central nervous system's position control response.

A novel, cost-effective impedance measurement technique is also presented, in which an expensive commercial force sensor is replaced by a virtual sensor incorporating a model of the robot's dynamics and kinematics. The technique is validated on a mass-spring system of known impedance and applied to the human arm.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis introduces a new approach for heavy-oil recovery from fractured reservoirs: Steam-Over-Solvent Injection in Fractured Reservoirs (SOS-FR).  The SOS-FR technique is a new technology proposed as an alternative method to the sole injection of steam or solvent and consists of three phases; Phase (1) produces heavy-oil by thermal expansion and conditions the oil for Phase (2), which is solvent injection, and Phase (3) is applied mainly to retrieve the solvent.  
Extensive experimental evidence and analysis were provided through static and dynamic laboratory scale experiments.  Static experiments were conducted to test four parameters: (1) Matrix wettability, (2) solvent type, (3) initial water saturation, and (4) matrix boundary conditions and size.  This was followed by dynamic experiments to test the effect of solvent injection rate on the process. Experiments were conducted using heavy-crude oil samples obtained from a field in Alberta on either wettability-treated sandstone (to mimic oil-wet behavior), or cleaned carbonate cores.
Visualization experiments were also performed on 2.5 cmx7.5 cm Hele-Shaw cells with different boundary conditions to gain an insight into fluid-fluid interaction between oil in the matrix and solvent in the surrounding fracture.  Interaction between oil saturated 2-D models and the hydrocarbon solvent surrounding it was analyzed qualitatively.  Two new dimensionless numbers were introduced as functions of fluid properties (viscosity, density, and diffusion coefficient) and matrix boundary conditions, and the numbers were correlated to oil recovery rate.
Finally, numerical simulations were conducted using a commercial software package for two main purposes; (1) history matching and obtaining an insight into the upscaling procedure from lab to larger scales, and (2) examining the efficiency of the process at the field scale (mainly large matrix sizes). 
The importance of this work is that it provides a novel perspective on the interaction between steam/solvent and heavy oil in the matrix, and presents an alternative technique for heavy-oil recovery from deep natural fractured reservoirs with tight and oil-wet matrix.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research investigates the buckling response of high strength steel (HSS) pipes with anisotropic material properties. The stress-strain responses of eight material types of grades X80 and X100 pipes were studied focusing on the elastic, yielding, and early plastic regions that affect the pipe’s buckling. Based on the observed hardening patterns in longitudinal and transverse directions, a combined hardening material model was introduced with linear isotropic and Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening rules. A simple method for model calibration was also introduced using longitudinal and transverse tensile stress-strain responses.
After validation with experimental stress-strain data, the anisotropic material model was used in the buckling analyses of HSS pipes to improve the accuracy of finite element simulations. Fifteen finite element models were developed for buckling analyses of HSS pipes previously tested under different load combinations. The results showed that using the anisotropic material model results in more precise simulations of the actual behaviour of HSS pipes compared to isotropic models.
The anisotropic model was employed in a parametric study to investigate the effects of material anisotropy and five other parameters on the critical buckling strain of HSS pipes. Finite element models were developed and analyzed with different values of diameter to thickness ratio, internal pressure, initial imperfection, material grade, strain hardening rate, and level of anisotropy. The results provide a better understanding of the effects of material properties on the buckling resistance of HSS pipes when there is a significant level of anisotropy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation examines the relationships between citizenship and sexuality and gender in imperial formations, through an archaeology/genealogy of the subject position of those classified as the hijra. Combining Lacan's symbolic order with Foucault's historic a priori in order to understand empire, this project examines two main questions: how were sexuality and gender -- notably manifest in the subject position of the hijra -- used as forms of political control in colonial India; and how transformations in empire were produced through changing representations of the hijra. Consequently, the hijra represent a key point -- or, in the words of Lacan, le point de capiton -- in the anchoring of a field of meaning that enabled colonial governance in both a diachronic and synchronic fashion; in other words, the figure of the hijra was translated by the colonial writers in such a way as to facilitate the creation of an ideology that privileged British understandings of sexuality and masculinity, not to mention civility, modernity, and, to a degree, religiosity, establishing British authority in the region. This project consists of a textual analysis of nineteenth-century British documents and writings, especially historical records, such as ethnographies, translations, census information, official reports, intra-government communications, and legal documents from the late eighteenth through early twentieth centuries, with a focus on the nineteenth. Through an examination of these sources, this dissertation explores how this group was translated by the colonial authorities; that is, it queries the conditions under which they were represented as a group that was constituted by those who were defined by sexual and gendered characteristics -- eunuchs, hermaphrodites, and impotent men.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Optimal management of type 2 diabetes requires a collaborative, team-based approach; however, the role of pharmacists on these teams has not been well-defined.   In the first study of this thesis, a systematic review examined components of pharmacist interventions to improve adherence to oral antidiabetic medications. The second study was a retrospective cohort analysis to determine how the pharmacist intervention in a randomized controlled trial achieved a significant improvement in blood pressure control. 
The systematic review identified that pharmacist interventions to improve adherence include educational strategies combined with behavioural, affective, or provider-targeted strategies.  In the cohort study, the observed improvement in blood pressure was likely due to pharmacist interventions to optimize antihypertensive medication management rather than improve medication adherence.
Pharmacists can be effective additions to collaborative care teams by providing education-based interventions to improve adherence and helping to optimize medication regimens to achieve treatment targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects women in their reproductive years.   Women with IBD often choose not to have children, and this voluntary childlessness may be due to their concerns regarding the adverse effects of their IBD and its treatment on fertility, pregnancy, and the newborn.  Patients often obtain information from their physicians, yet physician IBD-specific reproductive knowledge has not been well studied. 
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the relationship between IBD-specific reproductive knowledge and childlessness among women with IBD, and to characterize the relationship between IBD-specific reproductive knowledge and practice patterns (relative to reproductive issues) among physicians who treat women with IBD.   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of women with IBD (18 to 45 years old) and of physicians who treat women with IBD.  IBD-specific reproductive knowledge was measured on a 0-17 point scale by the Crohn’s and Colitis Pregnancy Knowledge (CCPKnow) survey with scores grouped as: poor (0 to 7), adequate (8 to 10), good (11 to 13), very good (14 to 17).  Multivariable logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for estimating the effects of exposure variables on the outcomes of interest.
RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: There was an inverse relationship between IBD-specific reproductive knowledge; increases in the CCPKnow score corresponded to decreases in the odds of childlessness.  Women with IBD had significant IBD-specific reproductive knowledge deficits, concerns, and beliefs/opinions.  Women with IBD often changed their family plans once they were diagnosed with IBD.  Discussion of family planning with a physician, specifically with a gastroenterologist, corresponded to lower odds of having poor CCPKnow scores relative to not discussing family planning with a physician.  Although almost two-thirds of physicians had very good CCPKnow scores, physician knowledge of IBD-medication use during pregnancy and breastfeeding was highly variable, revealing knowledge deficits in many physicians who treat women with IBD.  The Internet was an important source of information for both women with IBD and physicians.  Thus, internet-based educational activities aimed at both patients and physicians may be effective targets for improving IBD-specific reproductive knowledge among women with IBD. Improving IBD-specific reproductive knowledge among women and physicians will help ensure that women with IBD can make informed choices about having children. </etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the four leadership archetypes identified using the Competing Values Framework and patient safety climate in the ED. We used an established patient safety-rating instrument, the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, to assess the safety climate. The leadership archetypes were assessed using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Data were gathered using a survey tool approaching RNs from the Emergency Nurses Interest Group and the College and Association of the Registered Nurses of Alberta. Multivariate analyses were used to explore measures of patient safety climate and measures of the leadership archetypes using Pearson’s correlation and OLS regression models. The findings provide particular support for a contingent relationship between employee-centered leadership and entrepreneurial leadership, and patient safety climate in the Emergency Department. Employee-centered and entrepreneurial leadership archetypes were found to be instrumental in fostering patient safety climate in the ED.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Effective and adaptive conservation of a species requires knowledge of trend in abundance and distribution. Monitoring species that are highly mobile, cryptic, and occurring at low densities is especially challenging. This research investigates the local factors affecting the detectability of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in west-central Alberta, as well as regional factors affecting their eastern distribution in the province. When surveyed using a permanent DNA hair trap design, grizzly bear detection is maximized when sites are placed in areas with abundant buffaloberry and clover cover and near pipelines, wellsites, cutblocks, and streams. To the east, grizzly bear range is limited by agricultural zones, human settlements, and the loss of secure wild land habitat. Such information can help guide the placement of monitoring sites in core and peripheral habitats, which may help lower the cost of long-term monitoring programs of grizzly bear populations and range edge.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis presents the results of three studies examining the management
of migraine in children. First we conducted a systematic review of all clinical
trials conducted in children and adolescents of the acute migraine therapy. A
meta-analysis of the 26 randomized controlled trials is presented. A single trial with a focus on Emergency Department (ED) management was identified. As such, we then examined current ED practice in two retrospective practice
variation studies. The first compared four regional hospital EDs where practice patterns were significantly different between mixed population EDs (both adult and pediatric patients) and the tertiary pediatric ED. The second examined practice variation among ten tertiary pediatric EDs in Canada where significant differences were again observed. Factors that influenced the choice of medications included increasing patient age and the physician’s diagnosis of migraine. Important areas of future investigation include: (1) the effectiveness of intravenous fluids alone; and (2) the use of combined medications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Canadian school jurisdictions have adopted health promotion policies and guidelines as part of a broader comprehensive strategy to address childhood obesity, but there is limited research that has investigated how these “naturally occurring” population level interventions have influenced changes in school environments and student behaviours. Following the dissemination of various policies and initiatives related to health promotion in schools, the Province of Nova Scotia (NS) offered a case for research inquiry to describe how recent provincial policies were implemented. The purpose of this research was to provide contextual understanding of the adoption, implementation and impact of health promotion policies and practices in NS. Quantitative research was employed to describe provincial trends in children’s nutrition behaviour and weight status and to assess school practices across NS schools. Qualitative methods provided context on the processes that influenced implementation using a case study approach. From the quantitative analysis, although there were some improvements in diet quality, energy intake and healthy beverage consumption of children over time, there was no significant effect observed on body weight. Furthermore, schools reported greater adoption of curriculum-related practices, rather than practices that could foster comprehensive (i.e. holistic) approaches to school health. Contextual information from the qualitative case studies provided critical insight to understanding policy, organizational and individual outcomes. Schools that were stimulated by jurisdictional vision and provided with relevant resources and support exhibited processes that facilitated adoption of health promotion policies. Commitment, leadership and a supportive school culture was also found to be important to help schools overcome barriers to implementation. Overall, the contextual focus of this research provided a comprehensive account of health promotion policy implementation to advance the effectiveness and dissemination of population-level interventions in schools. Considering the multifaceted behavioural and social structural influences of obesity, illuminating this context in population-level interventions is critical to improve implementation and the overall impact on population-level weight status. Fostering collaboration between health and education sectors and establishing a broad system for support is essential to develop an understanding of the mutual benefit between health and learning and to progress the adoption, implementation and sustainability of school health initiatives.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: An abrupt interface between mountains and prairies in southwestern Alberta means wilderness areas and carnivore populations overlap cattle grazing lands.  Consequently, there is concern about the effects of large carnivores, especially wolves, on livestock.  I used GPS clusters and scat samples to determine year-round wolf diets in this region.   Both methods indicated a significant seasonal shift in wolf diets from wild prey during the non-grazing season to cattle in the grazing season.  The GPS cluster method effectively identified wolf kills but this method relies on telemetry with high accuracy and precision.  In southwestern Alberta, Argos satellite radicollars have been used extensively by wildlife managers.  I compare how differences in precision between GPS and Argos technologies affect the estimation of habitat-selection models.  Differences in accuracy and precision can lead to erroneous conclusions about animal selection of habitat.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study investigated factors associated with resilience in individuals with aphasia. Resilience is a phenomenon demonstrated when a healthy system of adaptation is present across several levels including individual or personal, family, community or society, in response to exposure to adversity such as communication impairment. Resilience was examined from the perspective of individuals who have experienced aphasia, and their families and caregivers. Sub-factors associated with successful outcomes for individuals with aphasia were identified through a qualitative approach using content analysis of personal interviews with persons who have experienced aphasia, their families, and caregivers. These sub-factors were grouped thematically to constitute the following major factors associated with the demonstration of resilience: support networks, person-first, and thinking positively.  These factors represent the views of people with aphasia and their caregivers who participated in this study, and parallel factors associated with resilience that have been identified in previous research with related populations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish revolutionized many fields in the scientific community, including molecular biology, protein engineering, and neuroscience. The ability to genetically link a fluorescent protein to a protein of interest has allowed scientists to probe the exact structural localization of proteins. Another important application of FPs is their design for use in biosensors, whereby the fluorescence of the protein is intrinsically dependent on a small molecule of interest, such as calcium ion (Ca2+) or a physiological process such as phosphorylation or caspase activity. In single FP-based biosensors of small molecules, the FP must be circular permutated, whereby the original N- and C-termini are linked together and new termini are introduced closer to the chromophore. At the start of the work described in this thesis a lot of work had gone into developing and improving GFP-based Ca2+ biosensors1,2, but there were no reports of a red FP-based biosensor. 
The work in this thesis describes the engineering of an RFP-based Ca2+ biosensor using a circular permutated RFP, mCherry. The first step in this process was to engineer a cpmCherry variant with termini near the chromophore3. mCherry required a lot of engineering and optimization in order to identify a fluorescent variant with termini near the chromophore. Ultimately, a cpmCherry split at position 145 was found that, when fused to calmodulin (CaM) and M13, showed a response to Ca2+. The initial construct had limited response and was subjected to several rounds of mutagenesis to improve both the brightness and fluorescence response. The final variant CH-GECO3.1 shows a 250% signal increase with Ca2+ and could be imaged successfully in mammalian cells to monitor Ca2+ fluctuations. 
To further our understanding of this biosensor, site-directed mutagenesis was done to probe the structure-function relationship. After mutagenesis a few residues stood out as key residues that likely played a role in the mechanism of fluorescence increase, such as Gln163 and Glu61 (linker). Other mutations were introduced into the protein to determine whether the excitation and emission wavelengths could be altered, while still retaining function. 
The final section of this work describes the reconstitution of split green and red Ca2+ biosensors using intein technology. Inteins will spontaneously splice together protein fragments that are genetically linked to them. To take advantage of protein splicing several different Ca2+ biosensors were split into and N-terminal and C-terminal fragments and attached to the N-terminal or C-terminal intein, respectively. These fragments were co-transfected into mammalian HeLa cells and imaged for fluorescence signal and response to Ca2+ fluctuations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Batch reaction tests were conducted on Lea Park shale from Pembina Cardium Field in Alberta to investigate geochemical alterations induced by exposing brine/CO2 mixtures at designed pressure and temperature. Dissolution of illite and growth of cluster-coating structures were observed on rock surface, all the cluster-coating structures disappears overtime followed by the precipitation of new clay mineral dominated material on the surface of work. Meanwhile, very low capillary entry pressure of 700KPa and ultra-low permeability of less than 1nD were measured for this caprock material which indicates that even though CO2 may easily penetrate into the caprock formation due to its low capillary entry pressure but it will be effectively be trapped due to its ultra-low permeability.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like 1 (SMARCAL1) is a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeler. It reanneals stalled replication forks to maintain genome integrity. It contains HARP domains that are necessary for the annealing activity. This thesis pursues structural studies of SMARCAL1 to understand its molecular mechanism. We establish an efficient E. coli expression system for the production of R. norvegicus and C. elegans SMARCAL1 orthologs. High yield and purity of six R. norvegicus proteins was obtained. One full length and five truncation mutants were designed to conserve the helicase domain and at least one HARP. These purified proteins were characterized and compared to an insect cell expressed human SMARCAL1 protein. DNA binding was assessed and the purified proteins displayed the typical preferential binding to fork DNA substrates. However, we determined that the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity reached similar catalytic rates for both fork and double stranded DNA.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In any geological sequestration projects, monitoring and verification are essential components in ensuring storage integrity.  Seismic methods are regarded as a feasible way to monitor the subsurface CO2 because of their sensitivity to a rock’s pore space content.  Therefore understanding the effects of CO2 and its variability on seismic response is important.   

Ultrasonic pulse transmission measurements were conducted on a porous ceramic sample and on a Berea sandstone sample.  P-and S-waveforms were collected under various pressures, temperatures, and fluid-type saturation.  The wave velocity and attenuation under full CO2 saturation and under a constant differential pressure were analyzed.  The presence of differing phase states and some phase transitions were notable from wave velocity and attenuation changes.  Only the observed wave velocities of the porous ceramic sample were in good agreement with Biot’s modelled results. Generally, CO2’s density plays a more dominant role than its bulk modulus on controlling the P-wave velocity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The purpose of this investigation is to formulate a theory of change. To this end, I first explore what goal(s) can productively inform a wide range of struggles. I argue in favour of an experimental ethics tentatively geared towards non-domination --a way of organising relations where parties have a hand over the way they are managed. Secondly, I explore what methods are best suited to achieve this goal. I argue that the path to non-domination involves two mutually sustaining processes. First is the cultivation of an ethics that revolves around self-rule, self-control, responsiveness, responsibility, and openness. The second process encompasses the deployment of techniques for change that are qualitatively compatible with non-domination. Such techniques include infrapolitics, discursive challenges, reform, and non-participation, but exclude confrontation and revolution. These two processes combine to prefigure non-domination here and now, if tentatively and imperfectly, instead of relegating it to a distant future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Leukocyte extravasation is a fundamental process of the inflammatory responses. The mechanisms that control remodelling of endothelial (EC) shape and adhesive contacts during leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) are not completely understood. We studied the role of EC phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity in lymphocyte TEM under shear stress conditions. Inhibition of EC PI3K activity by its pan inhibitors decreased lymphocyte diapedesis in a step after VE-cadherin opening. The importance of PI3K catalytic isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ and p110γ) were studied in TEM. Treatment of EC with isoform inhibitors of p110β, p110δ and p110γ did not affect lymphocyte TEM. Inhibition of p110α activity or expression reduced lymphocyte diapedesis. PI3K activity was measured in EC exposed to shear stress alone or shear stress on cells where ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 were cross-linked. The most significant effect was seen in cells cross-linked with ICAM-1 and exposed to shear stress. This suggests that cooperation of shear-induced mechanotransduction and ICAM-1 during leukocyte interaction with EC facilitates leukocyte diapedesis by inducing PI3K.
We hypothesized that Rho GTP proteins downstream of PI3K activity are involved in leukocyte TEM. We studied the role of IQGAP1, a Rac1/Cdc42 effector, during lymphocyte TEM. EC IQGAP1 knockdown decreases both microtubule (MT) tethered to the adherens junction (AJ) and lymphocyte TEM. Similarly, loss of AJ-associated MT induced by brief nocodazole (ND) treatment decreases lymphocyte TEM. Neither intervention affected leukocyte migration to the interendothelial junctions. These data indicate that IQGAP1 contributes to MT stability at endothelial junctions and is involved in the junction remodelling required for efficient lymphocyte diapedesis. We studied a candidate Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor named FGD5 upstream of IQGAP1. Inhibition of FGD5 expression resulted in more sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and a higher rate of apoptosis in resting conditions. Thus, we could not study the importance of FGD5 in lymphocyte TEM. Further characterization of FGD5 knockdown cells showed that they do not respond to VEGF signalling. These results suggest that FGD5 might play an important role in growth factor–mediated EC survival.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Diasporic identities may involve shifting forms of socio-economic class, status, culture, ethnicity and the like depending on one’s relationship with others (Lan, 2003; Pe-Pua, 2003; Seki, 2012).  Social networking sites (SNSs) may offer transnationals to do more than just keep in touch with loved ones.  Unlike other technologies (landline/mobile phones, email, instant messaging, voice-over IP service, etc.), the SNS design may also reveal ambivalent facets of their identities previously segregated through one-on-one or one-to-few modes of communication.  In SNS contexts, unexpected paradoxes, such as being labelled an ethnic migrant in the host country while simultaneously being stereotyped as a prosperous immigrant in the home country, may become more evident. 
Previous studies conclude that SNS facilitate the demonstration of diasporic identities (Bouvier, 2012; Christensen, 2012; Komito, 2011; Oiarzabal, 2012).  These platforms may allow diasporics to constantly and continuously renegotiate who they are to certain people.  This research investigates how Filipino diasporics may simultaneously perform their cultural identities on Facebook to loved ones in the home country, new friends in the host country and members of their diasporic community around the world.  Profile photos, status updates, photo uploads and video sharing may allow them to challenge Filipino stereotypes.
By combining Filipino indigenous methods and virtual ethnography, I acknowledge my unique position as a Filipino migrant.  Such means occupying an in-between space—as both an insider and an outsider (saling pusa).  While my research methods may seem aligned with virtual ethnography, pakikipagkapwa (development of trust through relationship-building) is my mother method.  Interviews and focus group discussions are more like casual conversations than formal data gathering techniques.  I treat participants as equals in our shared experience of renegotiating who we are as Filipino diasporics.  This is rooted in the Filipino core value of “kapwa” which views identity as a fusion of self and others.  Thus, I investigate how my participants and I renegotiate our cultural identities with Filipino and non-Filipino contacts on Facebook. 
Subtle renegotiations seemed to emerge through online pakikipagkapwa.  These result in new forms of Filipino diasporic identities that may seem more visible on Facebook than in our material encounters.  Such renegotiations may involve identity formation through deliberate association with and/or distancing from people in the way we enact kapwa as part of who we are as diasporic Filipinos through social networking.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Flax (Linum usitatissimum) has been grown as a source of oil and fibre for several millennia. Linseed flax varieties are cultivated for their seed (flaxseed) and for their seed oils (linseed oil), which are used for many industrial applications. The fibres that form in linseed straws are generally considered too poor to make these industrial uses economical. In order to better understand how the flax stem and its component fibres develop, the effects of two plant hormones, gibberellin (GA) and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA), on stem tissue properties were examined. GA levels were determined to be a particularly important factor in many aspects of linseed stem development, including bast fibre cellular elongation and expansion. The spatial, temporal and hormonal-responsive expression patterns of five genes putatively involved in GA response (LuGAST1), GA biosynthesis (LuGA2ox1, LuGA3ox1), IAA response (LuIAA1) and IAA transport (LuPIN1) were also examined. A potential association of increases in LuGAST1 transcription with the cessation of bast fibre elongation and onset of secondary cell wall biosynthesis suggested a potential involvement of LuGAST1 in these processes. Through a mutant screen of an elite linseed cultivar, a novel mutant was identified, reduced fibre1 (rdf), which lacks a normal complement of fully differentiated fibres in its stem. The preliminary characterization of rdf shows that RDF function may be required for bast fibre elongation. Polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were also identified which will be useful in future for facilitating the cloning and sequencing of RDF through map-based cloning.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this dissertation is to examine the socio-ecological implications of environmental changes and globalization for smallholder agrarian communities in Bangladesh. Drawing on concepts from agrarian political economy, Marxist geography and environmental sociology, this dissertation first outlines Bangladesh’s agrarian reform policies since the 1980s, and the resulting peculiarity of the country’s development trajectory. It investigates how the reforms have led to a paradoxical situation consisting of simultaneous proletarianization and an increasing number of households taking up smallholder farming. It demonstrates that the particular positioning of the state is central to understanding this paradox. This dissertation also analyzes the ostensibly disparate processes of mounting peasant indebtedness and the phenomenal rise of microfinance institutions in Bangladesh in light of the country’s broader agrarian context of agricultural commoditization, input subsidy reduction and a systematic lessening of the subsidized agricultural credit system. It argues that the spread of commercial microcredit is facilitating the process of peasant dispossession in the wake of neoliberal agrarian reforms in Bangladesh. Finally, this dissertation offers an in-depth analysis of how the intersection of markets, institutions and nature – both the immediate ecosystem and the broader climate system – shape peasant livelihoods in Bangladesh. By highlighting the adverse ecosystem effects of modern agriculture, this dissertation questions the merits of the country’s recent climate change and agricultural policies, which seek to scale up the use of bio-chemical agricultural technologies in an effort to minimize the impacts of climate change on agriculture. 
This dissertation advances our understanding of four different areas of study. First, it contributes to the literature on the agrarian question. Second, it enriches our understanding of rural financing and peasant indebtedness in the Global South. Third, it contributes to an emerging body of literature within the environmental sociology tradition, which seeks to analyze the combined impacts of economic development and environmental changes on resource-based communities. Fourth, this study makes an indirect contribution to the literature on Third World political ecology by highlighting how the interface between political economy and socio-ecological processes affect specific communities in developing economies.

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Drawing from philosophical, clinical, sociological, and activist literatures, my work critically analyses the deployment of biomedical models of mental disorder as a means of targeting stigma. I argue that “the stigma of mental illness,” when conceptualized within a biomedical framework, functions to 1) incite a multitude of discourses surrounding mental disorder, 2) extend the reaches of psychiatric surveillance and classification, and 3) streamline individuals and populations into particular modes of conceptualizing and disciplining the self. I argue that the rhetoric of stigma creates a series of new confessional venues, and determines the language and grammar through which mental disorder is made to speak. As a result of these scripts, counter narratives are outlawed, and their authors (i.e. consumer/survivor/ex-patient and Mad Pride activists) are routinely denied advantages accrued by socially authorized truth-tellers. I therefore conclude that the biomedical framing of anti-stigma rhetoric and discourse is, in part, complicit with the power relations that mark some individuals as mad. As such, anti-stigma discourse does not represent a radical break or historico-political rupture with “the stigma of mental illness” but is derivative of it. In light of these issues, I seek to develop an account of how we think about the functioning of, and relationship between, knowledge and power within anti-stigma discourse. My overarching concern, therefore, is not with what stigma is, but resides rather with what talking about stigma does.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In Chapters 1 and 2, we introduce the definition of interpolating refinable function vectors in dimension one and high dimensions, characterize such interpolating refinable function vectors in terms of their masks, and  derive their sum rule structure explicitly. We study biorthogonal refinable function vectors from interpolating refinable function vectors.  We also study the symmetry property of an interpolating refinable function vector and characterize a symmetric interpolating refinable function vector in any dimension with respect to certain symmetry group in terms of its mask. Examples of interpolating refinable function vectors with some desirable properties, such as orthogonality, symmetry, compact support, and so on, are constructed according to our characterization results.

In Chapters 3 and 4, we turn to the study of general matrix extension problems with symmetry for the construction of orthogonal and biorthogonal multiwavelets.  We give characterization theorems and develop step-by-step algorithms for matrix extension with symmetry. To illustrate our results, we apply our algorithms to several examples of interpolating refinable function vectors with orthogonality or biorthogonality obtained in Chapter 1.

In Chapter 5, we discuss some possible future research topics on the subjects of matrix extension with symmetry in high dimensions and frequency-based non-stationary tight wavelet frames with directionality. We demonstrate that one can construct a frequency-based tight wavelet frame with symmetry and show that directional analysis can be easily achieved under the framework of tight wavelet frames. Potential applications and research directions of such tight wavelet frames with directionality are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The combination of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) would yield a very powerful analytical technique. However, hyphenating both techniques is not easy. Sodium 4-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl) methoxy]-1-propane sulfonate (ALS) and sodium 2,2-Bis(hexyloxy)propyl sulphate (OALS) are  possible solutions to link MEKC with ESI-MS. They are surfactants that are hydrolyzable under acidic condition. Their hydrolysis products are compatible with ESI-MS. They can be utilized as pseudostationary phases to perform a separation and then acid-hydrolyzed before being introduced into the ESI-MS. Both surfactants are compared with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). ALS and OALS offer different selectivity than SDS. In term of mobility, ALS has a slower mobility than SDS. OALS has a greater mobility than SDS. ALS contains a cyclic ketal while OALS contains an acyclic ketal. OALS hydrolyzes much faster than ALS. The hydrolysis can be slowed down by lowering the temperature and vice versa.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Presented herein is a solid-state 71Ga and 69Ga NMR study of several six-coordinate gallium-oxygen compounds: Ga(acac)3, Ga(thd)3, Ga(trop)3, and (NH4)3[Ga(cit)2]·4H2O. Spectra of stationary and magic angle spinning (MAS) samples are reported, and their electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor parameters are determined at the 71Ga and 69Ga sites. Experimental results are complemented with density functional theory (DFT) calculations using CASTEP. Tensor parameters are compared with those of similar compounds containing other group-13 metals including 27Al and 115In, and periodic trends are considered. This work shows that solid-state NMR studies of gallium compounds are worthwhile and practical with modern techniques, as 71Ga and 69Ga NMR spectra of the chosen compounds were successfully acquired and interpreted. The potential for further studies is discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation explores the strategic possibilities of passivity as a form of agency in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British gothic novel in order to recuperate its representations of the passive female body as sites of feminist resistance. Using the methodologies of feminist and psychoanalytic theories and gothic literary criticism, this project examines four specific representations of passivity: fainting, sleep, illness, and death. These conditions are characteristic of a gothic mode that emerges with the birth of the novel, and continues to develop throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As such, this project closely examines key texts published at fifty-year intervals between 1740 and 1847. The first chapter considers Samuel Richardson’s proto-gothic novel Pamela (1740), whose titular heroine repeatedly faints when she is attacked by her rapacious master. The second chapter investigates violent bedchamber scenes in Matthew Lewis’s The Monk (1796) and Ann Radcliffe’s The Italian (1797), in which the would-be victims of rape and murder prove impenetrable, as their sleeping forms render their attackers impotent and immobile. The third chapter moves into the nineteenth century with an analysis of illness as strategic incapacity in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights (1847), while the fourth and final chapter returns to Richardson with an examination of the heroine’s will towards death in Clarissa (1748). The purpose of this project is to expand rather than narrow the gothic system of representation to include affirmative readings of passivity as a means to (re)discover embodied forms of subjectivity in the gothic novel.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Guided waves have been successfully used to characterize long bone properties, however the layer of soft tissue covering bone must be considered for guided wave technology to be clinically viable. We analyzed the impact of soft tissue through in vitro experiments on a cortical bone plate with and without a soft tissue mimic, and in vivo experiments on human tibiae. Data was examined using time-frequency analysis and frequency-phase velocity spectra. The data consistently exhibits two distinctive wave packets of different velocities. Guided wave modes A1 and S1 are generated in the soft tissue-bone plate model in addition to A0 and S0 generated in the bone.  The presence of soft tissue alters the guide wave energy distribution.  Most of the guided wave energy is concentrate around 0.1 – 0.2 MHz. The same phenomena are observed in the in vivo data. The in vitro experiments were in agreement with theoretical predictions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) establishes latent infections in neurons in vivo and lytic infections in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. During latent infections, HSV-1 transcription is restricted and the genomes are not replicated. Latent HSV-1 genomes are chromatinized, such that digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MCN) releases DNA fragments with sizes characteristic of nucleosomal DNA.  During lytic infections, in contrast, all HSV-1 genes are expressed, the genomes are replicated, and their digestion produces primarily heterogeneously sized fragments.  However, as evaluated by ChIP assays, HSV-1 DNA interacts with histones during lytic infections, although in most cases only a small percentage of HSV-1 DNA co-immunoprecipitates with histones (or is cleaved to nucleosome sizes following MCN digestion).  Therefore, although current models propose that chromatin regulates HSV-1 transcription, it remains unclear how the association of histones with only a small percentage of HSV-1 DNA can globally regulate viral transcription.  Moreover, the physical properties of the complexes containing histones and HSV-1 DNA are unknown. My objective was therefore to evaluate the biophysical properties of the HSV-1 DNA-containing complexes during lytic infection.  Differing from pervious studies, however, I used classical chromatin purification techniques.  I show that most HSV-1 DNA is in unstable nucleoprotein complexes and, consequently, more accessible to MCN than DNA in cellular chromatin.  This HSV-1 DNA is protected from MCN redigestion only after crosslinking, similar to unstable cellular nucleosomes.  HSV-1 DNA is in such complexes throughout lytic infection.  Using unrelated small-molecule inhibitors, I further show that inhibition of HSV-1 transcription is associated with a decrease in MCN accessibility of HSV-1 DNA.  Roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, prevents activation but not elongation of IE, E, and L HSV-1 transcription.  Consistent with a functional association between accessibility and transcription, roscovitine only decreases the accessibility of DNA templates of which it also inhibits transcription, independent of specific promoter sequences.  In summary, I show that most HSV-1 DNA is in unstable nucleosome-like complexes during lytic infection and that accessibility to HSV-1 DNA likely plays a key role in regulating HSV-1 transcription.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: A laboratory vortex generator was designed and fabricated to reproduce the behavior of this complex swirling flow. The vortex generator design was based on the results of computational fluid dynamics to optimize the performance, to reduce the cost, and to ensure kinematic similarity with atmospheric vortices. Stereo particle image velocimetry was used to investigate the flow velocity field generated by the instrument. In addition, laboratory scaled water vapour transport experiments were conducted, using a series of 128 solid-state humidity/temperature sensors. The results were used for successful validation of the numerical simulations. The study confirmed the expected effect that dust devils did indeed enhance mass transport. It was concluded that the radial Reynolds number was the most relevant scaling factor for this phenomenon. A numerical model with Martian conditions was then calculated to estimate the local water vapour transport rate from the Martian regolith with the presence of dust devil-like flows.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations are threatened across Canada.  Recovery plans are being implemented to address conservation priorities using the best available knowledge.  I used animal location data to evaluate sampling requirements for estimating caribou population ranges in Alberta, and developed resource selection functions to assess caribou response to landscape change for one population over a 13-year period.  Both the number of caribou and years sampled influenced population level inferences regarding range size.  Data were insufficient to generate stable range estimates for several populations in Alberta.  Caribou from the Redrock Prairie Creek population exhibited variable annual winter resource selection, but showed overall avoidance of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  A shift from the historical core range to a less disturbed winter range occurred over the 13-year sampling period, in conjunction with increased anthropogenic disturbance.   I provide guidelines for appropriate use of caribou location data for conservation and management planning in Alberta.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: Natural health products (NHP) are widely used by the public. Since NHPs are pharmacologically active products, their ability to cause adverse reactions (AR) is present and well-documented. Currently employed passive surveillance systems are not well-equipped to detect NHP adverse events (AE) due to issues with significant underreporting, lack of patient disclosure of NHP use to health care providers and patients not attributing an AE to a NHP due to their perception of safety with these products. Other types of surveillance systems, such as active surveillance, may be more appropriate to detect NHP AEs as increased detection has been documented with these systems. Pharmacists are well-trained to screen for NHP use and AEs, including interactions between health products. Once an AE is detected, causality assessment is required to determine if there is a causal link between a health product and the AE. Currently, no causality tools are available, or take into consideration, the evaluation of AEs involving NHPs. 
Methods: The work for this thesis was derived from two studies. The first study involved the implementation of active surveillance into community pharmacies to screen for the proportion of patients taking prescription drugs and/or NHPs, as well as their respective AE rates. All AEs reported by patients who consented to, and were available for, a detailed telephone interview were adjudicated fully to assess for causality. The second study involved developing, piloting and refining an adjudication process and subsequent causality assessment tools to be used to assess AEs; these process and tools were modified for inclusion of NHP-specific factors.  Important case reports resulting from the screening and causality assessment were used to translate knowledge to pharmacists. 
Results: We screened 1118 patients screened in 10 community pharmacies across Alberta and British Columbia, and obtained reports of 54 AEs. Of the 657 (58.8%; 95% CI: 55.5-61.6) patients who took prescription drugs and NHPs concurrently, 48 (7.3%; 95% CI: 5.6% to 9.6%) reported an AE. This AE rate is 6.4 times (OR; 95% CI: 2.5 – 16.2; p&lt;0.001) greater than those who took prescription drugs alone. On a national level, combined with data from Ontario, Canada, 45.4% (95% CI: 43.8%-47.0%) of Canadians that visit community pharmacies take NHPs and prescription drugs concurrently and of those, 7.4% (95% CI: 6.3%-8.8%) report an AE. Three causality assessment scales, Naranjo, Horn and WHO-UMC, were modified to include the assessment of NHP AEs. The adjudication process and scales developed were piloted in 24 cases (patients reporting an AE with NHP use and available for a full interview) and were able to assess causality of all cases. The tools were then refined by the adjudication team until no further changes were deemed necessary. Two cases found through this process were submitted and will be published in a well-known national pharmacists’ journal to highlight the importance of the data found to practicing pharmacists.
Conclusion: A substantial proportion of community pharmacy patients use both prescription drugs and NHPs concurrently; these patients are more likely to experience an AE than those taking prescription drugs only. Active surveillance provides a means of detecting such AEs and collecting high-quality data on which causality assessment can be based. The causality assessment tools developed allowed for full adjudication of AEs involving NHPs. Lastly, such data has clinical relevance for pharmacists in terms of raising awareness around NHP use and the potential risks for their patients.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Chinese is very different from alphabetical languages such as English, as there are no delimiters between Chinese words. So Chinese segmentation is an important step for most Chinese natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
We propose a tightness continuum for Chinese semantic units. The construction of the continuum is based on statistical informations. Based on this continuum, sequences can be dynamically segmented, and then that information can be exploited in a number of information retrieval tasks.
In order to show that our tightness continuum is useful for NLP tasks, we propose two methods to exploit the tightness continuum within IR systems. The first method refines the result of a general Chinese word segmenter. The second method embeds the tightness value into IR score functions. Experimental results show that our tightness measure is reasonable and does improve the performance of IR systems.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Among representation theorists, it is well known that Yangians can be realized as some type of degenerate form of quantum loop algebras. What is not well known is precisely how this degeneration takes place. In the first part of this thesis, we will demonstrate explicitly the process by which certain quantum loop algebras degenerate into an associated Yangian. In the second part, we will prove a theorem which classifies all of the finite dimensional irreducible representations of Yangians over complex semisimple Lie algebras.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The temperature distribution of a flame-sprayed metallic layer on
glass fiber-reinforced epoxy flat plates was determined experimentally,
analytically, and numerically. The composite samples consisted of flat
composite glass fiber-epoxy plates fabricated by filament winding, a layer of
garnet sand embedded in the epoxy, with similar thermal properties to the
glass fiber-epoxy layer, and a flame-sprayed aluminum-silicon (Al-12Si)
coating. The use of garnet sand to promote adhesion of the metallic coating
during flame spraying is novel. A second set of samples had a top layer of
glass fiber wound above the coating. A resistive heating wire was attached to
the coated surface at the leading edge of both sets of samples, while the
polymer and coating surfaces were exposed to forced convective cooling in a
wind tunnel. Thermocouples were attached to the polymer and coating to
measure the transient and spatial surface temperature distributions. Both
the coating and polymer surfaces experienced significant temperature
increases near the heating source, with a uniform decay of the surface
temperature away from the source. The surface temperature of the coating
was appreciably higher than that of the polymers, away from the heating
source. The use of a metallic coating to conduct heat on polymer structures is
also novel, and the results indicate that the metallic coating is an effective
conductor, while the polymer acts as an insulator.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: Urban form is a contributor to physical inactivity, which is a problem around the world. The association between urban form and physical activity is not fully understood, in part because improved methodologies of assessing urban form are necessary. This thesis consists of four studies that examined the association between urban form and physical activity in Edmonton, Alberta, using Geographic Information Systems. The research goals of this thesis were: (1) to compare two objective methods of assessing urban form walkability; (2) to examine the association between objective and subjective urban form measures and physical activity; and (3) to compare self-reported physical activity of individuals living in high and low walkability neighborhoods. 

Methods: Study 1 addressed Goal 1 and focused on objectively measuring urban form walkability based on public health and architectural (space syntax) measures. Study 2 addressed Goal 2 and focused on urban form association with self-reported physical activity. Study 3 addressed Goals 2 and 3 and focused on urban form association with self-reported walking. Study 4 addressed Goal 3 and involved an observational study of the pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicular movement in four neighbourhoods stratified by walkability and socio-economic status (SES). 

Results: Study 1 revealed agreement between public health and space syntax measures of assessing urban form. Study 2 revealed that only the objective environment was associated with physical activity. Study 3 revealed that only the perceived environment was associated with walking. Study 3 also revealed that walking as recommended was not different for individuals living in environments objectively assessed as higher versus lower in walkability. Study 4 revealed that observed pedestrian movement was higher in volume in neighbourhoods objectively assessed as higher in walkability. Cyclist movement was lower in volume in the neighbourhood classified as lower in walkability and in SES than in the other three neighbourhoods. Vehicular movement was no different in volume in the four neighbourhoods.

Conclusion: Both objective and subjective urban form influence physical activity. A common Social Ecological Models - Space Syntax framework would enable a better understanding of urban form influences on physical activity.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Known primarily for his success as a composer of opera, Jonathan Dove is gaining notoriety for his music for chorus and keyboard.   He describes this music as modal and rhythmic, taking its inspiration from the classical music of North India and the American minimalist styles that developed during the 1960s and 1970s.   The resultant post-minimalist style is both accessible and highly expressive.  Of the eight pieces in Dove’s oeuvre for chorus and keyboard, seven are settings of sacred texts for chorus and organ, and one piece, The Passing of the Year, is a setting for double chorus and piano of works by various English poets.  Written in 2000, the seven-movement choral cycle The Passing of the Year encapsulates Dove’s compositional language for chorus and keyboard and thus forms the core of this paper.  The works for choir and organ are also explored via their shared and, in some instances, expanded palette of compositional techniques.  Through an interview with Jonathan Dove, analysis of the scores, and a review of the small body of literature about his music, this study seeks to identify and describe the compositional elements which synthesize to form Dove’s distinctive compositional language.  In addition, the author will share insights gained with respect to Dove’s musical influences and intentions, and will provide a discussion of each of the movements in The Passing of the Year.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Tumor angiogenesis is the cancer-induced chaotic proliferation of blood vessel structure penetrating into surrounding cancerous tissue. Effective micro-vasculature imaging method is urgently desired for both fundamental biological and clinical studies. However, this is a challenging task, as existing standard imaging techniques are limited by factors such as poor resolution, high cost, necessity of using imaging contrast agent and invasiveness. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, as a non-ionizing modality, has drawn significant interest due to the promise it holds for high-resolution, noninvasiveness and its capability to reveal functional information based on intrinsic optical contrast.    
The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to further previous work on quantitative photoacoustic imaging, specifically, to contribute to quantitative imaging of tumor angiogenesis and anti-angiogenetic therapy. The work presented in this dissertation can be divided into three parts. In the first part, we focus on quantitative photoacoutic tomography (qPAT) for deep tissue imaging. We developed a series of algorithms that are able to quantify deep tissue photoacoustic imaging. We demonstrated by simulations that spatial distributions of optical properties, namely optical absorption and scattering, as well as the Grüneisen parameter can be faithfully reconstructed with our reconstruction algorithms. In the second part, we focused on developing new imaging platforms for quantitative photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) imaging for superficial imaging depths. We successfully included fluorescently-labeled molecular context in optical-resolution PAM (OR-PAM) imaging by our integrated micro-endoscopy system that is able to simultaneously accomplish fluorescence and OR-PAM imaging. With our fast, wide field-of-view OR-PAM imaging technique, we significantly reduced the data acquisition time of conventional OR-PAM systems to a clinically realistic level. In the third part, experimental work is presented for quantitative imaging of vasculature variations and oxygen depletions due to photodynamic therapy with an acoustic-resolution PAM (AR-PAM) system we developed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this thesis, we generalize the notion of asymptotically hyperbolic mass (first introduced by Wang in 2001) to manifolds with toroidal ends. Using this generalized definition, we show that under a normalized Ricci flow with asymptotically hyperbolic, conformally compact initial data with a well-defined mass, the mass will decay exponentially in time to zero, in contradistinction to the constant behaviour of asymptotically flat mass under Ricci flow. We then use this result for the evolution of asymptotically hyperbolic mass to prove that there does not exist a breather solution to the normalized Ricci flow with non-zero mass. Further, we provide a proof of the rigidity case of the Positive Mass Theorem in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting, using Ricci flow. We note that this result for the exponential behaviour of asymptotically hyperbolic mass provides support for a conjecture in general relativity stated by Horowitz and Myers.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research was designed to determine what conceptual changes occur when students use computer simulations, and whether simulations with characteristics defined as engaging by Adams et al. (2008a; 2008b), Granlund, Berglund, and Eriksson (2000), Kali and Linn (2008), Kim, Yoon, Whang, Tversky, and Morrison (2007), Lowe (2004), Malone (1981), and Wishart (1990), seem to promote conceptual change.  Six grade-ten students worked with three projectile-motion simulations in various orders.  Students drew pre- and post-treatment concept maps, their interactions with the simulations were videotaped, and they were interviewed. The results show that the students did experience conceptual change, but the changes were mostly within existing cognitive frameworks with few higher-order connections made.  As well, the simulation that engaged the students the most promoted the least conceptual change, and vice versa.  These findings support recommendations made in earlier literature that raise awareness of simulation features that tend to distract students from learning goals.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research focuses on documenting the efforts of the Waponahki people to design and pass legislated policy that effectively addresses racism and the process of colonization in school curriculum. The Waponahki, Indigenous to Maine and the Maritime Provinces, set precedent in both Canada and the United States during the late 1990s for the development of progressive educational policy that was implemented as legislated policy; two public laws and one state rule. Research on these policies, including the processes of their development, is significant because it provides an educational and social justice policy-making model. This work also contributes to the emerging discourse on Indigenous Research Methodologies as critical to the transformation of policy development theory and practice amongst Indigenous peoples.  In Alberta, Canada, the Aboriginal student population is the fastest growing of any other race/ethnicity in the province (Alberta Learning Commission, 2005). However, Aboriginal students have the highest drop-out rates, and are least likely of any group to complete university (Frideres, 2005 &amp; Statistics Canada, 2001).  Experiences of racism in schools continue and are cited as a leading reason for Aboriginal student attrition, and the implementation of policy and practice that values Aboriginal worldviews is key to Aboriginal student success in school systems (Hampton &amp; St. Denis 2004, Wotherspoon &amp; Schissel, 2003).  This research documents and analyzes the development of such policy from the lens of an Indigenous Waponahki researcher.   The project is also unique because it specifically articulates a Waponahki epistemology and ontology as its foundational research methodology.  Guided by the essence, practice, and principles of Waponahki basket weaving and creation story, the project examines two key pieces of legislation (public law) and one state rule that address racism and support language revitalization: in 2000, Maine Public Law Chapter 27, Title 1 MRSA §1102, more widely known as the Squaw Law; in 2001,Maine Public Law, Chapter 403, Title 20-A MRSA § 4706, known as the Wabanaki Studies Law; and in 2005, the Native Language Endorsement Rule, Maine Department of Education, 05 071 CMR 115 Part II section 1.17, a state rule authorized by the state legislature.  
	The study employs data collection methods that examine published documents, texts and individual interviews related to the three examples of legislated policy.  Discussions address not only the challenges and opportunities of designing and implementation, but also speak to how these legislated policies function in practice as policies that work toward Waponahki survival and beyond.  By discussing the development of these three specific examples as policies that evolved from the knowledge, traditions and colonial experiences of Waponahki people, this research describes and analyses how Waponahki ways of knowing (epistemology) and ways of being (ontology) inform policy-making processes in Maine.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Taking cues from the work of Paul W. Schroeder, this project seeks to investigate the particular conditions which allowed the Habsburg Monarchy and two of its leading politicians—Leopold II and Metternich—to have such pride of place in Schroeder’s ‘transformation’ of the European state-system. It contends that the international politics of restraint, reciprocity, and far-sighted collective security predate the French Revolution and the Habsburg reaction to it, instead proceeding from the Austrian experience in the 18th Century. At the same time, inspired by both constructivist and critical approaches to diplomatic history, this project aims to set this ‘Habsburg self’ against its ‘Bourbon other’ in a discussion of the Monarchy’s primary ally from 1756–1791: the Kingdom of France. In this sense it acts as a much-needed counterpart to the burgeoning literature on French perceptions of Austria, Marie Antoinette, and Austrophobia.  Far from a “deadlocked alliance”, what emerges from this analysis is the history of a relationship—founded on a significant degree of assumption of commensurability—which Habsburg policymakers consistently sought to improve through further investment and optimism, despite repeated disappointments. This structure serves to set France and Austria apart from the other Great Powers, particularly Prussia and Russia, in order to tentatively suggest that the diplomatic and foreign-policy cultures of ancien-régime Habsburg–Bourbon Europe anticipated the international order of the 19th Century.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis presents a method to determine the thermal diffusivity of both single-layered and two-layered coated samples. The flame spraying, air plasma spraying, and cold spraying techniques were used to fabricate the two-layered samples. Mathematical models were developed for single-layered and two-layered conduction heat transfer problems. Experiments were designed and tests were conducted to ensure that the mathematical models could give good prediction with the correct input of thermal diffusivity value. Experiments were conducted on samples, including single-layered samples of copper, aluminum, PMMA, and Pyrex and two-layered samples of TiO2 coating on copper substrate or low carbon steel substrate, YSZ coating on low carbon steel substrate, and nano-structured TiO2 on Pyrex substrate. 
The thermal diffusivity results of all the materials showed good repeatability and for low-thermal diffusivity materials, the test results agreed with the referenced value.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Theorists who endeavor to take sociality seriously have made substantial strides, but the phenomenological immediacy of experience has not been well explored or sufficiently addressed.  This dissertation proposes an approach to cultural psychology that accounts for such experience.  It addresses how authors such as Hubert Hermans, James Wertsch, Ken Gergen, Derek Edwards, and Jonathan Potter have tended to propose visions of cultural psychology that do not do justice to such experience, partly because they have different analytic interests.  Regardless, there is a need in current theorizing in cultural psychology to address culturally orchestrated action in a way that includes experience.  This dissertation attempts to address this need.  To provide an alternative view on cultural psychology, this dissertation turns to the Russian thinker, Mikhail Bakhtin, and his notion of speech genres.  The inherent sociality of embodied experience that is part of Bakhtin’s notion of speech genres is presented in contrast to the views of above-mentioned authors.   This work presents a view of Bakhtin’s discussion of realism in relation to experience and sociality.  This discussion leads to an alternative sociocultural understanding of individual agency that is central to the ontogenetic development of selfhood.  The discussion then progresses to examine what Bakhtin can contribute to a psychology embroiled in postmodernism.  Where self has been treated as socially constructed and changeable – such that notions like faithfulness to oneself, which is generally thought to belong in the domain of a true core self, are rendered futile – Bakhtin offers a view of embodied self that both requires and clarifies these notions.  The proposed alternative concludes by addressing how research could be conducted for those interested in extending the proposed cultural psychology in an empirical direction.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis is focussed on bone tissue engineering for improving the osseointegration of joint implants. We have incorporated nano-scaled materials called as Rosette Nanotubes (RNTs) which mimic the geometry of the natural components of bone with the growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein-7 (BMP-7). In particular, short peptide sequences were identified from BMP-7 (SNVILKKYRN, KPSSAPTQLN, and KAISVLYFDDS) and were linked with Twin K1 RNTs. The first stage of our study was focused on the purification and characterization of these short peptides co-assembled with RNTs using HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and their characterization by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) respectively. The Second stage involved cyto-compatibility studies of the RNTs. The third stage involved the adhesion studies of RNTs coated on different substrates. The fourth and final stage was the osteogenic differentiation studies of these materials. Results have shown that the HPLC purification yield was 12-20% and SEM characterization showed the presence of successfully assembled nanotubes. Coating of RNTs on different substrates has shown a significant increase in adhesion of human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (hBMSCs) on tissue culture treated plates and non-tissue culture treated plates. Moreover, peptide co-assemblies with Twin K1 RNTs have shown a significant increase in specific ALP (Alkaline phosphatase) activity. In summary, Twin K1 RNTs and peptide co-assembled RNTs have shown promising results for improving the cell adhesion on plastic substrates (treated and non-treated plates). Moreover, peptide co-assembled RNTs have shown early signs of osteogenic differentiation.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Purpose: This study examined whether parent physical activity (PA) is related to children’s PA, as measured with pedometers. 
Methods: As part of a longitudinal cohort study being conducted in Edmonton, Canada, 471 children between the ages of 6- and 10-years-old, wore SC-T2 pedometers for four consecutive days. 
Results: Significant small-to-moderate correlations between parent and child steps were found on day 1 (r = .24), day 2 (r = .24), day 3 (r = .19), and day 4 (r = .33). After controlling for covariates, parent steps remained a significant predictor of both girls (p &lt; .001) and boys steps (p &lt; .001). Parent steps also remained a significant predictor of child weekend (p &lt; .001) and weekday steps (p &lt; .001) after controlling for covariates. 
Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of parent PA modeling in promoting children’s PA and suggests that parents may be optimal targets for intervention.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Background: N-of-1 trials are prospectively planned, multiple crossover evaluations, conducted in individual patients. Evidence shows that a range of designs and statistical methods have been applied to N-of-1 trials. This thesis helps to provide a comprehensive understanding about the methodology and reporting of N-of-1 trials by synthesizing all published evidence. Furthermore, while the primary objective of N-of-1 trials is to assess treatment response in individual patients, this thesis explores whether any secondary benefits can be derived from N-of-1 trials and the data they generate. Given the number of N-of-1 trials conducted in the area of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, this condition was chosen as the clinical model explored in the  thesis.                                   Objectives: i) To provide a systematic overview of published N-of-1 trials; ii) To assess how N-of-1 trials that have been conducted to assess the same interventions for the same conditions, using identical outcome measures can be aggregated in order to yield group estimates of treatment effect; and iii) To assess how N-of-1 trials can be combined with RCT data into a single meta-analysis.       Methods: A series of systematic reviews were conducted in which each review consisted of a thorough search strategy, an assessment of inclusion of primary studies, a risk of bias assessment and either a qualitative or quantitative synthesis of data. A second reviewer was involved in all reviews.
Results: This thesis found that N-of-1 trials have been conducted in over 50 conditions, and that the majority of published N-of-1 trials are published as a series. Our findings
also indicate that N-of-1 trials can be meta-analyzed across participants in order to yield population treatment effect estimates. Furthermore, we found that combining N-of-1 trials with RCT data into a single meta-analysis, impacts both the magnitude and precision of overall treatment effect estimates.                                          Conclusions: This thesis examined the potential for N-of-1 trials beyond their primary purpose of providing estimates of individual treatment effectiveness and demonstrates a method of aggregating N-of-1 trials across participants as well as with RCT evidence. Clinical and research recommendations on how to move this field forward have been provided.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study focused on the nature of friendship in each of two dyadic relationships between a young adult with a developmental disability and a nondisabled peer. Students with developmental disabilities who are included in university and college classes will meet nondisabled peers as inclusive education becomes more prevalent at the postsecondary level. The basic interpretive interviews captured on video helped to explore the nature of their friendships. Included were third-party informants, a parent and a professor, who illuminated the important themes that emerged during the research.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Increased  expression  of  autotaxin  has  been  shown  to  promote  metastasis formation and cancer proliferation.  These actions could be related to the catalytic activity  of  autotaxin  which  converts  lysophosphatidylcholine  into lysophosphatidate extracellularly or non-catalytic functions of autotaxin may be responsible.  Also both LPC and LPA have been reported to stimulate migration through their respective receptors.  This work investigates the role of autotaxin in controlling  the  motility  of  two  cancer  cell  lines.  With  the  use  of  autotaxin inhibitors  we  were  able  to  block  LPC-induced migration.  Knocking-down autotaxin  secretion  also blocked  stimulation  of  migration  by  LPC.  Autotaxin 
inhibitors abolished any migratory effects from media collected from autotaxin secreting cells.  We determined that LPC alone is unable to stimulate migration.  Also we did not observe non-catalytic effects of autotaxin on migration.  This thesis provides strong evidence that the inhibition of autotaxin production or activity would provide a beneficial therapy in the prevention of tumour growth or metastasis in patients with autotaxin expressing tumours.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Core flooding experiments were performed to understand in-situ coal bioconversion process. Subbituminous coal particles packed inside a biaxial core holder was inoculated with microbial culture and was continuously flooded with mineral salts medium and nitrogen rich nutrient solution. Colonization and conversion of coal by microbes was evident from the presence of metabolites and gases in the effluent. The identification of signature metabolites of anaerobic bioconversion of hydrocarbons shows fermentative microbes are able to convert the complex coal over a period of time to simple molecules such as acetic acid, which is a substrate for methanogenesis. Presence of succinic acid in the effluent, suggests that the coal bioconversion process can be used for extraction of other value-added product apart from CH4 generation. The results presented here indicate that the coal bioconversion by biostimulation at reservoir conditions is a scalable technology with great potential to reduce overall greenhouse gas emission.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation aims to propose a new and practical method to obtain equivalent fracture network permeability (EFNP), which represents and replaces all the existing fractures located in each grid block for the reservoir simulation of naturally fractured reservoirs. To achieve this, first the relationship between different geometrical properties of fracture networks and their EFNP was studied. A MATLAB program was written to generate many different realizations of 2-D fracture networks by changing fracture length, density and also orientation. Next, twelve different 2-D fractal-statistical properties of the generated fracture networks were measured to quantify different characteristics. In addition to the 2-D fractal-statistical properties, readily available 1-D and 3-D data were also measured for the models showing variations of fracture properties in the Z-direction. 

The actual EFNP of each fracture network was then measured using commercial software called FRACA. The relationship between the 1-, 2- and 3-D data and EFNP was analyzed using multivariable regression analysis and based on these analyses, correlations with different number of variables were proposed to estimate EFNP. To improve the accuracy of the predicted EFNP values, an artificial neural network with the back-propagation algorithm was also developed. 

Then, using the experimental design technique, the impact of each fracture network parameter including fracture length, density, orientation and conductivity on EFNP was investigated.  On the basis of the results and the analyses, the conditions to obtain EFNP for practical applications based on the available data (1-D well, 2-D outcrop, and 3-D welltest) were presented.  This methodology was repeated for natural fracture patterns obtained mostly from the outcrops of different geothermal reservoirs. The validity of the equations was also tested against the real welltest data obtained from the fields.

Finally, the concept of the percolation theory was used to determine whether each fracture network in the domain is percolating (permeable) and to quantify the fracture connectivity, which controls the EFNP. For each randomly generated fracture network, the relationship between the combined fractal-percolation properties and the EFNP values was investigated and correlations for predicting the EFNP were proposed. As before, the results were validated with a new set of fracture networks.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The five-membered carbocyclic framework is a prevailing structural motif found in natural products and bioactive compounds.  Over the years, the Nazarov reaction has been continuously refined as a versatile protocol to access cyclopentanoid products.  In this dissertation, several projects built on Nazarov chemistry will be detailed.
Recent research activities regarding umpolung reactivity at the carbonyl α-carbon, a relatively underemphasized carbonyl umpolung, is discussed in Chapter 1.  The cationic intermediates generated during the Nazarov cyclization have been shown to participate in domino or cascade sequences, thus providing a convenient entry to expeditiously increase molecular complexity from relatively simple precursors.  Chapter 2 describes a comprehensive investigation of new bond-forming reactions initiated by the Nazarov reaction wherein umpolung reactivity at the α-carbon of cyclopentanones was achieved through the interception of 2-oxidocyclopentenyl cations derived from the initial electrocyclization with an array of carbon nucleophiles.
Alternative substrates to the key pentadienyl cation intermediate in the Nazarov reaction, potentially offering access to unconventional substitution patterns or milder conditions, have recently attracted considerable interest.  Chapter 3 discusses the use of vinyl silyloxyallenes, which function as dienone surrogates through Brønsted acid activation, to effect the Nazarov cyclization.  Additionally, a novel extension of the vinyl allene version of the Nazarov reaction, involving an interrupted Nazarov reaction employing pendent aromatic traps will be presented.
Chapter 4 recounts a novel, two-step, modular synthesis of α-amidoindanones.  This process is based upon the Nazarov cyclization of 2-amido-1,4-pentadien-3-ones that were in turn prepared via a novel coupling process between α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and an α-lithiated allenamide.

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Infant face and throat replicas are used in research laboratories to compare the effectiveness of different valved holding chamber and face mask designs. The use of soft face models is thought to provide a better representation of mask dead volume and face mask seal than hard face models. However, a comparison of mask dead volume, face mask seal, and lung dose for soft versus hard face models is lacking. 
This study compares mask dead volume, face mask seal, and lung dose for hard ABS, soft silicone, and very soft polyurethane facial materials at two clinically relevant applied forces: 1.5 lb and 3.5 lb. Mask dead volume is quantified using water displacement. Face mask seal is quantified using flow rate measurement. The lung dose of beclomethasone dipropionate delivered via a Qvar® pressurized metered dose inhaler with AeroChamber Plus Flow-Vu™® Valved Holding Chamber and Small Mask, defined as that which passes through the nasal airways of an idealized infant model, is quantified using a bias tidal flow system with a filter. A mathematical model is used to predict lung dose based on experimental results of mask dead volume and flow rate through the valved holding chamber.
This study shows that a greater lung dose is obtained using soft face models as compared to hard face models, with a greater difference at 1.5 lb than 3.5 lb. Face mask leakage led to decreased dose consistency and therefore a sealant should be applied when measuring lung dose with a hard ABS or soft silicone face model at 1.5 lb of applied force or less. Parametric analysis with the mathematical model showed that differences in face mask seal between face models were more predictive of lung dose than differences in mask dead volume.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop a framework for risk assessment of CO2 geological storage projects. This is achieved using the BowTie approach as a framework for capturing the failure of CO2 geological storage, and using BowTie approach to combine different failure mechanisms such as wellbore leakage and caprock leakage in a linguistic manner. One of the major difficulties in expert judgment is subjective and dispersed opinion around risk. This research attempts to define dispersed opinions as experts plan knowledge level over different risk hazards by using the Dempster-Shafer theory. In this study, belief on experts’ judgments propagate through the right hand side of the BowTie structure (which is fault tree structure) using Boolean algebra and the Dempster-Shafer theory, while expert-evaluated index on caprock and wellbore propagate through the fault tree section of the BowTie structure using fuzzy logic theory. Finally, risk and belief are combined to assign different belief values to different evaluations of calculated risk values. In this study, the concept of fuzzy logic is explored as one approach to characterizing the risks associated with CO2 storage in the Weyburn project. The Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project is considered sufficiently well documented to demonstrate the applicability of fuzzy set theory to risk assessment of carbon sequestration projects. Public data available for the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme (IEA GHG) Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project is used for modelling and to assess the applicability of the proposed approach.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis explores the social, political, and spatial extensions of food and eating in nineteenth-century young women’s coming-of-age texts in America. It focuses on novels and short-stories from women authors such as Louisa May Alcott, Susan Coolidge, Eleanor H. Porter, and Sarah Jewett in order to unpack both young women’s and young men’s complex relationships to food while examining the culture that shapes restrained, social eaters. This research is grounded in textual representations of the complex framework of nineteenth-century girls and young women in the kitchen, along with boys and young men in domestic eating spaces, while engaging with the social and political significance of the spaces in which these characters eat and cook.
Chapter One discusses the ways in which boys in Alcott’s Under the Lilacs and Little Women series, along with Dorry in Coolidge’s What Katy Did, struggle to adopt appropriate relationships to food and their appetites—relationships that guide them into successful futures as ideally masculine men. Throughout these texts—novels targeted toward girls and young women in the nineteenth century—young male characters struggle to negotiate their identities as enthusiastic eaters of female-prepared food with social pressures to develop into hardworking, masculine men in control of their appetites.
The second half of this thesis hinges on arguments of the history of space, and the ways in which food is deeply intertwined with architectural shifts in domestic spaces. Chapter Two primarily looks at Eleanor H. Porter’s 1913 novel, Pollyanna, and discusses Pollyanna’s ability to develop cross-class relationships with lower-class female characters in the text while using food and eating spaces as a means of transcending class boundaries.
The third and final chapter continues exploring themes of space, as it analyzes the ways in which the kitchen becomes an increasingly feminized space in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It looks at the ways in which by creating spaces of collective cooking and food sharing, these authors transcend the boundaries of the feminized cooking space and reject social rituals that isolate women in the kitchen.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Research in the field of hairstyling in Alberta has been tremendously neglected, especially concerning the full term programs offered at private vocational colleges. Current research suggests that there has been a significant decrease of apprentices completing and receiving their Journeyperson certificate in hairstyling. This study identified and examined two factors affecting enrollment and completion of students registered in the full term hairstyling apprenticeship program and completion of students receiving their Journeyperson certificate in Alberta. Three sources of data were used, researcher’s field notes, self-administered questionnaires, and one-on-one semi-structured interviews. The research participants consisted of current managers and owners from seven post-secondary full term hairstyling trade institutes in Alberta. The study determined that insufficient support from the Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board and lack of financial funding at the provincial level was shown to have the greatest influence on apprenticeship completion rates in private vocational hairstyling institutes in Alberta.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Question:  Can a wet meadow plant community be established on abandoned peatlands through broadcast plant diaspore spreading in western Canada?  Does fertilization impact the development and establishment of the wet meadow?
Location: Evansburg, Alberta, Canada
Methods:  Wet meadow vascular and non-vascular species were spread under 2 treatments on an abandoned peatland.  The effect of spreading and fertilization treatments were tested using a factorial randomized unbalanced design repeated six times.  Treatments were used to statistically test main effects and interactions. A barley (Hordeum vulgare) straw mulch cover was applied on all experimental units.
Results:  Plant spreading was an effective restoration method for establishing vascular wet meadow vegetation on sites with sufficient moisture.  The treatments that included plant spreading had 80% coverage by wetland dependent vegetation and a distinct decline in agronomic and upland species.  Fertilization had no significant effect on plant cover. 
Conclusion:  The use of a modified Sphagnum moss layer transfer method to establish a wet meadow plant community on a post-abandoned peatland was successful and contributes to the development of a new approach towards managing abandoned peatlands in mid-continental boreal Alberta, Canada.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In "Badiou, Political Nihilism, and a Small-Scale Solution", I argue that Badiou’s presentation of politics, exclusively on a large scale – that of the nation-state – betrays his underlying set-theoretic ontology. The consequence of presenting politics on this scale is that political events, opportunities for genuine political engagement, are extremely rare. This leaves potential political actors with little reason to believe they will have the opportunity to engage in politics. The absence of meaningful engagement, along with Badiou’s unique conception of truth, gives rise to the problem of political nihilism. But, just as sets are both composed of sets and couched within others, situations too should be viewed as scalable. Re-presenting politics on a multiplicity of scales overcomes the worry about nihilism, while better capturing the real complexity and texture of political commitments.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This dissertation proposes two internal analyses of market structure that can be applied to widely available store-level brand sales and price data. The methodologies, based on either a sales response model (a reduced-form model) or a discrete choice formulation (a structural model), enable researchers to identify the latent asymmetric competitive structure within a pre-defined market.
	Chapter 2 estimates a market map of competitive brand relationships that are assumed to jointly underlie cross-price elasticities, own-price elasticities, and brand-specific intercepts in a sales response (i.e., market demand) model. The methodology uses an adaptive Bayesian approach to stabilize the estimation of demand parameters by sharing information across different brands and different model components in a set of demand equations. Drawing upon recent psychometric research, I express the asymmetries present in cross-price elasticities as the difference between what I refer to as brand power parameters, and I identify relationships between a focal brand’s power parameter, clout, vulnerability, own-price elasticity, and spatial density.  I apply the model separately for two datasets that consist of weekly sales and prices for beer and soft drinks.
	Chapter 3 proposes a utility-based structural model and shows how the combination of the aggregate scanner data and forced switching data can help estimate a market map directly from a utility-based formulation. The utility function specification accounts for both vertical and horizontal differentiation across alternatives, and also incorporates consumer heterogeneity.  The specification is modeled to underlie both market outcomes (e.g., unit sales) and forced switching behavior.  Conceptually, the proposed model relates the concept of asymmetric competition with fundamental parameters present in the utility function.
	The two models developed in this dissertation represent complementary ways of conducting internal analysis of market structure.  Chapter 4 discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages of each for application in different contexts.  Chapter 1 introduces the topic of market structure analysis and summarizes antecedent research streams that have addressed this topic.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Scratch test and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were applied to study the effects of thiosulfate on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of Alloy 800 in simulated crevice solutions. The results showed that thiosulfate cathodically shifted the pitting potential of Alloy 800 significantly and the pitting morphology on the electrode surface was also different from that formed in the absence of thiosulfate. The synergistic effect between thiosulfate and stress was also observed, which was mainly promoting enhanced anodic dissolution at active sites.

     In the lead-induced stress corrosion crackings (PbSCC) work, the crack propagation rate (CPR) of Alloy 800 double cantilever specimen were estimated in neutral crevice chemistries solutions at 300 degree Celsius. The PbSCCof alloy 800 at high temperature were investigated by comparing the CPR rate of Pb-contaminated and Pb-free conditions. A repetitive behavior of crack advance was observed from the measurement. This observation is consistent with the film rupture model.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In a context of international crisis, regionalism and regionalization are captivating academic attention as instruments for change. I aim to answer a main question: Does the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) entail a transformative exercise of government in this region? Also, what does the characterization of UNASUR as ―postneoliberal‖ imply and how is it formulated? This critical theoretical study draws on governmentality and decoloniality to evaluate the transformative potentialities and novelty of regionalism and, specifically, UNASUR. This thesis contributes to the knowledge of regionalism first, by assessing determinism and flaws of mainstream regionalism research; second, assessing the shared assumptions underlying the research of UNASUR; third, identifying the South American initiative‘s political rationality and alternative excluded rationalities. Based on the decolonial stance, this thesis concludes that UNASUR‘s political rationality is not transformative. Rather, it may be understood in the context of mainstream regionalism research reproducing the modern/colonial matrix of power.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Paleomagnetism is a fundamental tool to understand the ancient variations of Earth’s magnetic field through time. Important applications to geochronology and paleography come from interpreting the variations of the planetary magnetic vector. This dissertation explores the different applications of paleomagnetism to uncover important characteristics of the paleointensity magnetic field during the Permo-Triassic boundary and the nature of the apparent polar wander path (APWP) of Siberia, and to create geochronological frameworks for kimberlites in the Siberian platform and for sediments at the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.
Detailed absolute paleointensity measurements from Permo-Triassic sills at the Siberian platform are studied to determine the existence of a low dipole field, which has been previously reported in the area. We found a mean virtual dipolar moment value of 6.01 ± 1.45 × 1022 Am2 which is over 50% higher than the results previously obtained by other authors.
Diamondiferous kimberlite pipes are exposed across the north-central part of the Siberian platform. The age of the magmatic activity cannot be clearly determined from isotopic age data – this is the reason why new paleomagnetic poles from four kimberlite pipes are obtained to study their paleomagnetic age. On the basis of a comparison with the Siberian APWP, we estimate the age of the kimberlite magmatism. The acquired paleomagnetic ages span from the Early Silurian to the Middle Late Jurassic.
Magnetostratigraphic analysis is used as a dating tool on three deep drilling cores that penetrate Santonian-Campanian strata in southern Alberta, Canada. Chrons 34n and 33r are clearly identified from the studied sections - providing a high-resolution age boundary that creates new age boundaries between adjacent stratigraphic units. In addition, normal polarity zones are observed within C33r, previously described as reverse polarity over its entire length.
Siberian APWP contains long unresolved segments; therefore, the nature of the path depends largely on the curve fitting method used. A least square fitting method computed through singular value decomposition is applied to create the path. The method is compared to a smoothing cubic spline fitting and to the most recent version of the Siberian APWP from the literature. For the Mesozoic Era two possible scenarios are explored.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Syria has witnessed major changes in the twenty-first century. Educational reform and change in
curricula were part of this wave of changes. Globalization processes have affected the direction
of many of the changes that took place in the country. In this dissertation, I started by exploring
the educational system in Syria and the changes that took place in the last decade. Educators’
perspectives were provided to shed the light on educational change in Syria such as changes in
the science and math curricula as well as professional development practices in Syria. Topics
such as assessment, languages in the curricula and technology were also explored. A critical
interpretive study of the changes, informed by post-colonial theoretical perspectives, guided the
study of changes and trends that are taking place in the educational system in Syria. Globalization
processes and the political context in Syria have affected many of the changes that took place in the
last decade. Tutoring and shadow education were explored as an increasing phenomenon in
education with a great impact on public education.
The study showed the need to support teachers and give them a greater role in educational
change and curriculum reform. It emphasized on the bottom up approach to change and the
importance of understanding context and valuing indigenous knowledge. Furthermore, the study
provided a critique of the rush to copy what is perceived as best practices without careful
consideration of the context and consequences of such changes. In addition, recent changes in the
Syrian situation were highlighted and the new emerging needs of Syrian students were explored.
Reform in educational practices as well as professional development should be done with teachers as
initiator of such reform. Furthermore, curriculum should be responsive to the needs and traditions of
Syrian students. Assessment practices and further changes in the way teachers are assessed should
complement any change in curricula. Furthermore, problems in the educational system should be
addressed to reduce inequalities and decrease dependence on tutoring and shadow education. The
! iii!
quality of education in the public system should be sufficient for students to learn without the need to
look for alternative modes of delivery. This also comes with improving the status of teachers and
treating them as partners in education. An awareness of globalization processes and awareness of the
increased presence of NGOs and foreign involvement in Syrian education is needed before any
change is brought about. The history, tradition and knowledge of Syrian people should be celebrated,
encouraged, and considered when planning any reform. Despite the current desperate situation for
Syrians inside and outside Syria, education can provide hope for the future of Syrian children.
Planning such education with the involvement of community members and educators will provide
better chances for the Syrian people who suffered a lot and deserve a better future.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Physical activity is important for obesity prevention. Given that the prevalence of obesity among Canadian children has substantially increased over recent decades, and that obesity has substantial consequences for health and wellness, physical activity promotion continues to be a priority for public health. This thesis research aims to further our understanding of children’s behavioural patterns where they relate to physical activity and obesity. It also aims to identify factors and effective strategies that increase physical activity among children. These aims were assessed through six interconnected research papers. In the first paper we demonstrated that consideration should be given to activities not captured by pedometers as adjusting crude pedometer-measured steps for these activities substantially improved the ability to accurately assess children’s physical activity levels, and to identify children who were obese. In the second paper we revealed that policy makers should consider targeting physical activity in girls, and outside of school as these variables and time periods were characterized by low activity. In the third and fourth papers we showed that parental beliefs and support for physical activity were positively related to children’s physical activity achieved on weekend days, and negatively associated with childhood overweight. In the fifth paper we demonstrated that school programs that support physical activity through positive environments, curriculum, policy, and partnerships lead to improvements in children’s physical activity both during and beyond school. In the last paper, we revealed that programs implemented in schools located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods reduced inequalities in physical activity. Furthermore, we found that although the programs were implemented school-wide and did not specifically target student subgroups, they were effective in increasing physical activity relatively evenly among low-active, active, and high-active students. Likewise they relatively evenly reached normal weight and overweight students, and those of distinct socioeconomic backgrounds. The results of this thesis provide researchers and policy makers with new evidence on important determinants of physical activity in children from an Albertan context. They also underline the importance of supporting strategies for physical activity promotion and specifically school health programs as these improve physical activity, reduce obesity prevalence rates and diminish health inequalities.</etd_ms:description>

Also in the study area, is the vein hosted Nori/RA (Mo-U±Cu-REE), which has less affinity to the IOCG class of deposits.
In this work, trace and major element analyses, along with stable (C, H, S, O and Cu), radiogenic isotopes (Re-Os), and fluid inclusion studies were used to constrain the origin of the IOCG systems, and the Nori/RA showing, and to suggest the potential of magnetite as a mineral indicator in till sampling exploration surveys.
 Regionally, the Cr/Co ratio is higher in barren and pre-ore magnetite compared to that of magnetite co-precipitated with ore minerals and/or present in ore-rich veins and breccias. At DAMP and Sue Dianne the Co/Ni ratio is extremely high and clearly different from those of other GBMZ magnetite samples. 
Collectively, the analytical data supports a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for all these systems that are temporally associated with the emplacement of the Great Bear volcanic arc between 1875 and 1865 Ma. However, some sulfur, copper and arsenic could have been recycled from carbonate-rich metasedimentary and rocks and incorporated in the ore-bearing fluids as is suggested for the NICO deposit. Some copper might have also been leached from felsic volcanic rocks and metasedimentary rocks and incorporated into the GBMZ mineralized systems. In NICO deposit, Ca-Na-Bi(Au?)-bearing, and saline (~20 wt.% NaCl equiv + CaCl2 equiv) to hyper-saline aqueous fluids (&gt;42 wt. % NaCl equiv.) formed at 4 to 8 km depth. The Au mineralization in this system occurred via: (i) remobilization of refractory gold and Bi(?) from Fe-S-As-S mineral phases during re-crystallization of the latter, and (ii) scavenging of Au by Bi melts from co-existing hydrothermal fluids.
Despite the stable isotopes signature, and the geochronological constraints, mass balance calculations shows that felsic volcanic and metasedimentary rocks hosting these deposits are feasible sources of metals (e.g., Au, Co and Cu) for the GBMZ IOCG systems. However, for this to be true, it would require high permeabilities and efficient fluids capable of leaching, concentrating and re-precipitating metals at a single site, and a suitable hydraulic regime.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Despite the growing popularity of animal-assisted literacy programs in North
America and abroad, little research has examined how children experience these
programs or what their significance may be for participating children in the elementary
classroom context. Designed as an interpretive case study into one Grade 2 classroom
over 10 weeks, this study explored the questions: How do children experience literacy
learning with a dog and an adult mentor? What significance do animal-assisted literacy
learning experiences have for children? Drawing on contemporary, cross-disciplinary
research exploring the human-animal-bond (HAB) with children in school and therapeutic settings and research examining school-based mentoring programs, this study explored the potential for unique forms of social, emotional, and academic support for children when they engaged in animal-assisted literacy learning sessions.

Insights from this study suggest that animal-assisted literacy mentoring programs can offer children valuable forms of social, emotional, and academic support in the classroom context. Specifically, four main themes emerged inductively from the data: (1) Animal-assisted literacy sessions drew the consistent and enthusiastic participation of all of the children in the classroom and were viewed as anticipated escapes from typical school routines; (2) These sessions invited playful, imaginative literacy teaching and learning opportunities for group participants; (3) Novel and familial modes of interrelationship within these sessions transformed the network of relationships among group members, and finally; (4) The students' positive, transformative associations with literacy in the broader school context and in their home literacy lives collectively contributed to a carnivalesque climate of literacy support. This study suggests that while
the adult and dog can be defined as 'literacy mentor teams' during animal-assisted literacy learning sessions, this term provides a necessary but insufficient description of the nature of the interactions among group members. Given these insights, future research is warranted to explore the experiences and significance of animal-assisted literacy learning for children in other grade levels and in other socio-cultural contexts.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The confined impinging jet reactor gives efficient mixing performance as required for fast reactions. In this work the mixing performance of CIJR is characterized through three measures: estimates of the energy dissipation, micromixing efficiency based on the yield of a homogeneous (iodide-iodate) reaction and particle size resulting from a heterogeneous (iron oxide) precipitation reaction. Whereas product yield and energy dissipation are used to test operational robustness of CIJR, iron oxide model system is used to study the effect of feed flow rate (mixing) and reactant concentration on precipitate agglomerate size. Mixing and concentration effects on nucleation, particle growth and particle agglomeration are tracked to understand the agglomeration process. Various types of stabilizers and additive concentrations to limit particle agglomeration are also tested. Effects of in situ and post-reaction sonication on agglomerate size are also investigated. Efforts are made to determine variations in mixing efficiency the operational robustness of the scale-up (2X and 4X) geometries. Also efforts are made to identify scaling parameters and the limit on geometric scale-up for good mixing performance.
	
Energy dissipation is found to vary between 20 W/kg and 6800 W/kg in CIJR and decreases on scale-up at constant Reynolds number. The operation of the CIJR and the scale-up geometries is robust to changes in flow rate, exhibiting stable performance up to 30% difference in inlet flow rates.  Reliable mixing performance is obtained until 2X scale-up, while at low flow rates, the jets fail to impinge in 4X scale-up, and sometimes failing to fill the reactor volume.
 
Iron oxide primary and agglomerate particles are seen to vary with flow rate and reactant concentrations. Largest primary particles (and smallest agglomerates) are obtained at high flow rates and high reactant concentrations, which indicate to size dependent agglomerative tendency of the primary particles. Stabilizers added in situ see limited success. Post-reaction sonication is helpful in dispersing soft agglomerates, but in situ sonication shows no significant reduction in agglomerate size with or without stabilizer. Primary particles are understood to agglomerate due to collisions induced by Brownian motion, simple shear and velocity fluctuations in turbulent flows. These collision mechanisms operate at different length scales in the fluid mass.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: High density/high atomic number metallic objects create shading and streaking metal artifacts in the CT image that can cause inaccurate delineation of anatomical structures or inaccurate radiation dose calculation. 
We developed techniques for reducing metal artifacts in both megavoltage CT (MVCT) and kilovoltage CT (kVCT) images. We remodelled the iterative maximum polychromatic algorithm for CT (IMPACT) by adding a model for pair/triplet production and incorporating the energy dependent response of the detectors and successfully applied it to two MVCT systems. In the corrected image of a phantom, the error in the measured electron density of a plexiglass background was &lt;1%. The mean deviation of measured electron density (0.295 1.695 relative to water) for a range of materials was &lt;3%. For the kVCT beam, a thickness ≥13 mm of steel plate resulted in photon starvation at the detector. The modifications, similar to those for MVCT, made to kVCT in the IMPACT algorithm did not improve its performance due to photon starvation. 
An algorithm (MVCT-NMAR) was developed that uses prior information from MVCT images to correct artifacts in kVCT. The MVCT-NMAR greatly reduced the metal artifacts in kVCT without deforming structures and did not introduce secondary artifacts except for a few faint streaks. The radiation doses calculated on those corrected images were closer to the doses in a reference image due to the more accurate CT numbers. These improvements were significant when compared to the commercial metal artifact correction method (OMAR algorithm in Philips CT scanner). 
The MVCT-NMAR algorithm was further improved to remove remaining fine streakings and applied to the images of five patients. The technique greatly reduced the metal artifacts and avoided secondary artifacts. Those were significant improvements over the commercial OMAR correction method and depended upon accurate registration of the MVCT and kVCT images. Large dose reduction outside the planning target volume was observed for a prostate cancer patient when these images were used without the requirement that beams avoid passing through prostheses in TomoTherapyTM treatment plans. Thus the use of MVCT NMAR corrected images in radiotherapy treatment planning may raise the quality of cancer treatments for patients having metallic implants.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of some cardiovascular diseases and contributes to the observed increased overall mortality rate. It also influences the action and disposition of drugs including some of the cardiovascular agents that are commonly used by patients with inflammatory conditions. This may result in reduced response to pharmacotherapy.  
       Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, old age and obesity result in altered response to verapamil as measured by the PR prolongation despite increased plasma drug concentration. Interestingly, the action and disposition of verapamil are restored in patients, whose rheumatoid arthritis is in remission, pointing to the possibility that the degree of disease severity may have a role in the above observation. 
       Both the reduced clearance, hence, increased plasma drug concentration and diminished pharmacological response caused by inflammatory conditions have been attributed to down-regulations of target proteins, i.e., drug metabolizing enzymes and receptors, respectively. 
       As our first objective, we investigated the effect of disease severity on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of verapamil, a well-studied representative of the calcium channel blockers. As a model of inflammation, we chose Crohn’s disease. We observed that increased disease severity decreased response to the drug while elevating its plasma concentration. 
       
As our second objective, we studied the action and disposition of nebivolol in rat adjuvant arthritis. Nebivolol is a third generation β-blocker and is thought to be exclusively metabolized in the liver. It is administered as a racemate of equal ratios of the D- (S,R,R,R) and the L- (R,S,S,S) isomers. It has some unique mechanisms of action including a high selectivity for β1 and β3-adrenoceptors. Nebivolol has the ability to release nitric oxide from the cardiovascular endothelium and possesses antioxidant properties which can increase the level of NO by reducing its oxidative inactivation. These benefits suggest nebivolol as the drug of choice in patients with cardiovascular complications when inflammatory conditions exist. 
       As our third objective, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol with the aim of finding whether its intestinal metabolism contributes to its first-pass metabolism in the rat. We also investigated the stereospecific pharmacokinetics of nebivolol to determine factors which cause stereoselectivity in its disposition. Our results revealed that the pharmacological response to nebivolol remained unchanged in the presence of inflammation and the gut rather than liver is responsible for drug’s first pass metabolism. The drug’s pharmacokinetic profile is stereoselective due to its stereoselective binding to plasma proteins. This study revealed that neither the pharmacokinetics nor pharmacodynamics of nebivolol are influenced by inflammation, making it unique among the thus far investigated β-blockers such as propranolol and sotalol.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis describes the role of Spanish as a common language in the construction of social networks among the diverse Spanish-speaking population of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Analysis of the data confirms the low public visibility of the community observed initially, despite the even larger numbers of Spanish speakers living in the city than initially estimated. The community’s relatively low level of coherence and its minimal presence in the public sphere can be explained by two main factors: an exceptional degree of diversity among members (described in terms of national, religious, political, socio-economic and ethnic variations), and a set of ambivalent attitudes regarding the relative value of Hispanic culture. This community’s public anonymity is also discussed as related to the larger realities of Canada’s official policy of multiculturalism and popular discourses of Hispanidad in Anglo-Canadian mainstream culture.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This research comprises a series of papers to address the methodology of studying hunter-gatherer mobility in prehistoric populations.  As a laboratory for this research, middle Holocene hunter-gatherer groups from Cis-Baikal, Siberia were analyzed as part of ongoing research by the Baikal Archaeology Project.  Paper no. 1 focuses on theoretical considerations of how researchers approach the concept of mobility with regard to hunter-gatherers along with regional background information and discussions on the specifics of using geochemical techniques to track human mobility in the archaeological record.  Paper no. 2 presents the methodology to enable laser ablation ICP-MS analysis of teeth for strontium isotopic research with specific focus on correction procedures for known interferences encountered using laser ablation as a sampling method. The paper also presents groundwork for a new approach in trace element analysis of teeth for provenancing purposes.  Paper no. 3 presents the technique of micro-sampling of skeletal materials for laser ablation with specific focus on long bones. The purpose of micro-sampling is to target bone micro-structures to access diagenetically resistant portions of the bones and to recover biogenic strontium isotopic and trace elemental data.  Paper no. 4 presents the results of extensive regional geochemical mapping including plants, water sources and faunal remains throughout the Cis-Baikal region.  Coupled with this map is an analysis of molars from 16 individuals recovered from small cemeteries distributed across the Cis-Baikal region.  General characteristics of the geochemical environment and mobility patterns elucidated through further provenance analysis are discussed too.  Finally, in paper no. 5, a summary of all new findings is presented along with the assessment of the methods employed in this research.  As theoretical and analytical considerations intertwine, the resultant inferences can provide astounding revelations about prehistoric populations.  For the middle Holocene hunter-gatherers of Lake Baikal, Siberia, this approach provides valuable new insights and research directions.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The aims of the present study were to comprehend the behavioral effects of hands-free telecommunication on the hemodynamic responses and examine their relationship with the driving errors during the intervention. To study cerebral hemodynamics (using Near Infrared Spectroscopy) during distracted driving, 26 male participants drove in a simulated urban scenario, without (4 minutes) and with (2 minutes) naturalistic conversation using a hands-free earpiece. Two trials of each intervention were conducted. Driving errors were counted; NIRS and heart rate data were collected. The results indicated that driving with hands-free telecommunication led to an increase in driving errors, neuronal activation of the left frontal lobe (evident by a significant increase in oxy-hemoglobin and decrease in deoxy-hemoglobin) and heart rate compared to driving without telecommunication. Changes in NIRS variables were not correlated with driving errors possibly due to heterogeneity of NIRS data.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Migratory behaviour of the Ya Ha Tinda (YHT) elk population is diminishing while the number of residents remaining on the YHT winter range year-round is increasing.   Previous research addressing the fitness consequences of each migratory strategy assumed there was no advantage to either segment when they shared the YHT winter range.  In testing this assumption, I found no spatial segregation of migrant and resident home-ranges during winter. Both groups were exposed to similar forage resources and residents were exposed to higher night-time, but not day-time predation risk.  Residents were better than migrants at reducing the foraging costs of vigilance and increased vigilance in areas of high wolf predation risk, but not near human activity because of habituation. Migrants were not habituated to humans and exhibited more constant vigilance regardless of spatial variations in risk.  My results do not support the previous assumption.  Instead, I found residents may be at an advantage on the winter range while forage is abundant and no snow is present.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Aboriginal children on-reserves across Canada are lagging far behind their non-Aboriginal counterparts with regard to educational achievement. Related research and statistics provide evidence that a high proportion of Aboriginal people not graduating from high school and that Aboriginal children are entering into the school system unprepared and ill-equipped to succeed both in the short and long term. In response, the federal government established the Aboriginal Head Start On-Reserve (AHSOR) program in 1997 in order to equip young students with the tools necessary for success in school and to get a good start in life. The objective of this research is to explore the extent to which the AHSOR program achieves the stated objectives of the program which are to “help enhance child development and school readiness of First Nations, Inuit and Métis children living in urban centres and large northern communities” (Health Canada, 2011b, para. 1, emphasis added) as well as those children living in First Nation communities. Following a detailed exploration of the program, this thesis concludes that the AHSOR program is unlikely to meet the program’s overarching objectives. Further, this thesis concludes that this program, as a singular approach, will not be sufficient in improving the levels of educational disparities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Droplets exist widely in our everyday life and various industries. Numerous studies have been done to explore droplet systems and among them Gibbsian surface thermodynamics is a powerful means to investigate these highly curved systems. Due to the development of modern technologies and the introduction of novel materials, new systems have arisen that require this type of investigation. Here we have chosen two multiphase droplet systems of recent interest: the first one is droplet nucleation on a soft substrate as a modern material and the second one is the microdrop concentrating process which is mainly used in microfluidic technologies. 
Gibbsian surface thermodynamics is a rigorous method to predict the behaviour of highly curved surfaces such as droplets, bubbles, capillaries or colloid systems. This approach includes finding the conditions for equilibrium and explores the nature of each equilibrium state, i.e., whether it is stable, unstable or metastable. The stability analysis is done by means of free energy calculation and the amount of an energy barrier determines the required energy for nucleation. 
In the first system of interest, we provide a mathematical explanation for easier droplet nucleation on a soft substrate compared with a rigid surface, an effect which has been observed experimentally by other researchers. In the second system of interest, we study the microdrop concentrating process which has application in microfluidic microdrop platforms. We provide the first thermodynamic description for microdrop concentrating of two types of solutes—those with and without solubility limits—and explore the role of different design parameters on the equilibrium states. Next we perform thermodynamic stability analysis of the process to determine the behaviour of the system at each equilibrium state. Finally, the role of the Ostwald–Freundlich equation describing the effect of curvature of the precipitated solutes within the microdrops is fully explored.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Psychology students are introduced to several major schools of modern psychology, including Albert Ellis’ rational emotive therapy (RET), and Aaron Beck’s cognitive therapy (CT). Both of these theories are based on analyzing and changing the way clients think. However, introductory psychology textbooks typically do not compare and contrast these two major theories in any depth. As such, the goal of this thesis was to compare RET and CT. The author found that a few differences exist between the theories of RET and CT, and that the main distinction lies in the style of therapeutic relationship recommended and practiced by each theorist. All the differences identified by the author appear to be at least partly due to Ellis’ and Beck’s divergent personal backgrounds and interpersonal characteristics. The implications of this conclusion for training novice psychologists are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

geometric object. This study aims to use persistent homology to explore the effect
of Human Biotherapy on patients suffering from Clotridium Difficile Infection. The
data is presented in the form of several distance matrices and these are analyzed
applying summary statistics of persistent homology, namely barcodes, persistence
diagrams and persistence landscapes. It is found that there is a difference in the area
under the persistence landscapes before and after treatment in dimensions zero and
one. These differences are explored using projection onto lower dimensions using
isometric mapping. It is found that there are differences in the number of clusters
in dimension zero and the number and length of loops in dimension one.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The topic of this thesis is the palaestrae of Roman Africa. Although many examples of palaestrae have been found in North Africa, there has never been a study solely focused on these facilities. They have usually been considered only in the context of Roman baths and as features of bath buildings. This thesis examines palaestrae in a new light and analyzes their role as athletic facilities within the sporting culture of Roman Africa. The Roman provinces of North Africa have yielded a particularly rich body of evidence for athletic games and festivals, making this region ideal for studying this topic.
The concern of the thesis is twofold. The first issue is the design and construction of palaestrae in Roman Africa. There is discussion of their form, of construction techniques, and of their place in the overall design of baths. The second issue is how their form relates to function. There is a discussion of how palaestrae accommodated athletic activities, such as training and competition.
	The thesis concludes that palaestrae in Roman Africa were an important part of local athletic culture, used for training and possibly for competition. Greek and Roman models influenced their design, but climate played a significant role. Great effort was made to ensure these buildings were kept cool, not only by placing them in less exposed areas but also by insulating them from the heated rooms of the baths. Local resources and building techniques were important factors in their construction. This thesis includes a gazetteer of palaestra sites in Roman Africa and a catalogue of all inscriptions relevant to the use of palaestrae.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Interfacing metals with semiconductor surfaces at the nanometer scale has received much attention, as a result of the critical importance of these interfaces for applications such as integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and others.  An efficient and versatile approach for the synthesis of metallic nanostructures on a variety of semiconductor surfaces, including GaAs, InP, silicon [Si(111), Si(100) and Si nanowires], and germanium, is galvanic displacement – a spontaneous electrochemical reaction that is a member of the electroless deposition family.  These hybrid nanostructures have intriguing properties but have not been elucidated and therefore not understood.  To better illuminate the nature of these systems we use a number of different analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanobeam (~5 nm) selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), as well as high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging.  In spite of the fact the reaction is carried out in water, the growth of gold on silicon and germanium surfaces is heteroepitaxial. This high degree of alignment (heteroepitaxy) was directly observed by high resolution TEM imaging the interface between gold and single crystal germanium and silicon substrates, revealing a coincident site lattice (CSL) of four gold lattices to three of the semiconductor substrate (low lattice mismatch).  In the case of Au/Ge, we were able to tune the texture nature of the gold epilayer by changing the composition of the deposition bath.5 
Galvanic displacement of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on Si nanowires (NWs) showed very interesting phenomenon – Au NPs exhibit preferential deposition on the Si(110) faces of Si nanowires, grown along &lt;112&gt; growth direction, than on the Si(111) faces.  The direction of elemental diffusion across the metal-semiconductor contacts was investigated.  Spectroscopic (AES) investigations suggest little diffusion of the metals into the semiconductor lattice.  Finally, the intermetallic nature of metal-semiconductor interfaces was substantiated by depth profile X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nanobeam diffraction analyses.  Hence, galvanic displacement offers a very attractive method for wiring in nanostructures to semiconductor chips, allowing for its use in modern technological applications.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: One of the ways to improve electric power transmission systems is to efficiently utilize the capacity of the existing power circuits. That can be achieved by increasing the thermal ratings of the transmission lines. In this research, weather-based rating approaches were studied. Static thermal rating (STR) strategies (probabilistic and seasonal) and a new dynamic thermal rating (DTR) approach based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the DTR approach allows better line utilization compared to STR methods. It was also shown that the postprocessing technique called model output statistics (MOS) can significantly reduce errors in numerical weather simulation, improve the accuracy of the DTR system, and reduce the risks of line overheating. Efficient data management, processing, and visualization were investigated to fully utilize the potential of an advanced DTR system. Applications of the latest web-based technologies, geospatial databases, and 3D visualization techniques are presented.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Purpose: evaluate 1) reliability and accuracy of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for assessing adenoid size compared to nasoendoscopy (NE), 2) Influence of clinical experience on CBCT diagnosis.
Methods: Four blinded evaluators reviewed randomized CBCT images. Adenoid size was graded on a 4-point scale for CBCT and NE (by an pediatric otolaryngologist). Reliability was assessed with intra and inter-observer agreement. Accuracy was assessed with agreement between CBCT and NE, plus sensitivity / specificity analysis.
Results: 39 consecutively assessed, non-syndromic subjects (11.5 ± 2.8 years) were evaluated. CBCT demonstrated excellent sensitivity (88%) and specificity (93%), strong accuracy (ICC = 0.80, 95% CI ± 0.15), and very good reliability, both within observers (ICC = 0.85, 95% CI ± 0.08) and between observers (ICC = 0.84 ± 0.08). Clinical experience of the CBCT evaluators did not have a statistically significant effect.
Conclusions: CBCT is a reliable and accurate tool for identifying adenoid hypertrophy.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This study investigates the extraction of hydrocarbons from oil sand using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2). Experiments were carried out on three different types of oil sands. After some preliminary experiments, the feasibility of extracting hydrocarbons from oil sands by SC CO2 was confirmed and three experimental factors (pressure, temperature and mixing rate) were identified for further study. A two to the three factorial design was used to determine the significance of each factor and the significance of the interaction of the factors on the extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency was calculated from Dean-Stark extraction analysis and was compared to the extraction efficiency based on gravimetric analysis. The results show that the extraction efficiency increased with pressure at a constant temperature. The effect of temperature on extraction efficiency is complex. The highest extraction efficiency was obtained at the high pressure (24.1MPa), high temperature (60°C) and a mixing rate of 250rpm.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In this study I compared independence and interdependence in Canadian (N = 43) and South Asian immigrant mothers (N =49) and their children (Canadian: N = 44, South Asian: N = 47), living in Edmonton, which is an Anglophone city in Western Canada. Canada and South Asia have been classified as individualistic and collectivistic cultures respectively (Hofstede, 1980). I used self-report measures to assess mothers’ inter/independence orientations on several dimensions, namely family allocentrism, Asian values, self-construal, traditionalism and modernity. In addition, I assessed socialization for independence or interdependence in a story-telling task with mothers and children. I found that South Asians were more interdependent in private domains such as family relations and independent in public domains such as employment and education. Mothers in both cultures gave importance to the development of independence as well as interdependence in their children. However, in the story-telling task, South Asian mothers encouraged more interdependence than Canadian mothers. South Asian children also showed more interdependent orientations than Canadian children. This study demonstrates that a domain-specific description best explains people’s independence and interdependence. In addition, this study also emphasizes the utility of using a mixed methods approach to understand the socialization process.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The creation of rich, immersive game worlds is one of the major goals for designers of modern story-based games. The inclusion of unique and interesting dialogues for all of a game's non-player characters (NPCs), especially the secondary NPCs, does a great deal to increase the believability of the game world being created. Unfortunately, the creation of such dialogues can be very time consuming, and is often considered to be prohibitively expensive. In order to address this problem, I introduce the concept of an Intentional Dialogue that allows designers to efficiently and effectively create multiple variations of a dialogue while ensuring that the variations are appropriate to the NPCs that will be speaking them. I will also introduce several support structures for the Intentional Dialogues and a machine learning classifier that allows designers to quickly populate the system with both new and existing content.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves are believed to play an important
role in the dynamics of energetic particles (both electrons and ions) trapped
by the Earths magnetic field causing them to precipitate into the ionosphere via resonant interaction. In order to incorporate the EMIC-related loss processes into global magnetospheric models one needs to know solar wind and magnetospheric conditions favourable for EMIC wave excitation as well as the localization of the waves in the magnetosphere. EMIC waves are generated by anisotropic (Tperp/Tpara &gt; 1) ion distributions. Generally, any process that leads to the formation of such distributions may be responsible for EMIC wave initiation. This thesis discusses magnetospheric compression as a new principal source of EMIC wave generation in the inner dayside magnetosphere.
First, using ground-based and satellite instrumentation, it is shown that EMIC
waves are often generated in the inner dayside magnetosphere during periods
of enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure and associated dayside magnetospheric compression. The compression-related EMIC wave activity usually lasts for several hours while the magnetosphere remains compressed. Also, it is demonstrated that EMIC waves are generated in radially narrow (1 Re wide) region of high plasma density, just inside the plasmapause.
Test particle simulations of energetic ion dynamics performed for this study
confirmed that anisotropic ion distributions are generated in the compressed
dayside magnetosphere, the temperature anisotropy being dependant on the
strength of magnetospheric compression. It is found that in the inner magnetosphere these anisotropic particle distributions are formed due to particle drift shell-splitting in an asymmetric magnetic field.
Finally, the generation of EMIC waves was studied self-consistently using a
hybrid particle-in-cell code in order to determine whether the degree of anisotropy estimated from the test particle simulations is sufficient to produce EMIC waves like those detected and to explain some of the observed wave properties.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Osteoclasts are the sole cells responsible for bone resorption and their activity is central to the process of bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclast activity leads to increased bone resorption, predisposing individuals to bone conditions such as osteoporosis, Paget’s disease and the focal bone erosions seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, the pharmacological arrest of osteoclasts is the mainstay of treating many bone diseases. However, none of the current antiresorptive therapies for bone loss target osteoclast cells directly. As osteoclasts express the Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B (RANK) receptor, the essential signaling receptor for osteoclast differentiation, it was hypothesized that antibody-like molecules generated with specificity against RANK could selectively target and deliver conjugated drug cargo to the osteoclast.
	The objectives of this thesis were to generate, characterize and evaluate monoclonal antibodies against the osteoclast RANK receptor, in order to develop a pharmaceutical platform capable of selective and targeted drug delivery to osteoclast cells. Using hybridoma technology, a specific monoclonal antibody against recombinant human RANK receptor was generated. Synthesis of osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates with that antibody was conducted using the antiresorptive peptide hormone calcitonin. Conjugate characterization was undertaken and its efficacy tested on osteoclast cell cultures using various osteoclast specific assays. Both the conjugate as well as the antibody itself showed remarkable inhibition of osteoclast activity. The desirable result obtained with the mere binding of the antibody to the receptor led us towards new research work, focusing on valuable scale-up production and therapeutic use.
	As a new research direction, single-chain Fraction variable (scFv) antibody-like molecules was expressed against the human RANK receptor using phage display technology, to circumvent complications associated with murine-derived antibodies. The Anti-RANK scFv showed specificity towards osteoclast RANK receptors and also showed an inhibitory effect on osteoclast activity. 
	With the increase in development trends for biologics as therapeutics and the growing knowledge on the importance of osteoclast targeted therapy, this novel biologic reagent may find utility as “universal osteoclast targeting platform”. This may provide a meaningful strategy in terms of osteoclast targeting and drug delivery with the aim of treating or controlling the progression of osteoclast related bone disorders.</etd_ms:description>

This study quantified four aspects of land use and land use change effects: 1) ecosystem C stocks and distribution; 2) soil respiration; 3) soil C mineralization; and 4) net ecosystem productivity. Land use systems studied include agriculture (AG), 2-yr- and 9-yr-old hybrid poplar plantations (2HP and 9HP, respectively), grassland (GRA), and native forest stand (NAT). Ecosystem C stock in NAT (223 Mg C ha-1) was similar to 9HP (174 Mg C ha-1) and both were significantly greater than AG (122 Mg C ha-1), GRA (121 Mg C ha-1), and 2HP (110 Mg C ha-1). Cumulative soil C loss via soil respiration averaged over two growing seasons was in the order of: NAT (7.81±0.40 Mg C ha-1) &gt; 9HP (5.51±0.31 Mg C ha-1) &gt; GRA (5.23±0.30 Mg C ha-1) &gt; AG (5.02±0.24 Mg C ha 1) &gt; 2HP (4.28±0.20 Mg C ha-1). Depending on land use, seasonal heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration had respective contributions to soil respiration of up to 35 and 83%. Soil C mineralization of bulk soil across the land uses ranged between 2 to 5% of initial total organic C (Ci), with mineralization rates ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 µg C mg-1 Ci d-1 and mean residence times ranging from 30 to 51 yrs. Across particle size fractions, soil C mineralization was in the order of: AG &gt; HPs &gt; GRA &gt; NAT of which the coarse fractions, representing labile C, were the main source of mineralized C (79%). Mineralization increased when NAT was converted to AG; and decreased when AG was converted to HP or GRA. Net ecosystem productivity across land uses, expressed in terms of C, ranged between  2 (AG) and 11 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (older HP). Conversion from AG to GRA increased net ecosystem productivity three-fold. When AG was converted to HP, the plantation was a C source in the first four years and became a C sink by year five. Results obtained from this study are relevant to modeling efforts designed at determining the impact of future climate change on a variety of land uses.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Stainless steel is one of the most commonly used materials in most industries. Excellent corrosion resistance of stainless steel is due to the formation of an oxide film on the surface (passive film), which protects the material from continuous corrosion attacks. When subjected to an attack combining corrosion and erosion, the passive film is damaged and thus, higher and unpredictable degradation rates are observed, which may result in costly consequences.
In the first part of this study a model was developed for erosion enhanced corrosion of 304 stainless steel. A new device was designed and constructed, which made possible the impingement of single particles on the surface of sample material at different impact velocities and angles. Based on the electrochemical response of material to the impact of single particles, a model was proposed that considered the number of the impacting particles on the surface. The predictions made by this model were later compared with the results of a slurry jet experiment, which was used to simulate the service conditions.
The second part of the research included the basic mechanical and electrochemical studies of the interactions occurring between the particle and material surface during the particle impact. This included the effects of different impact parameters such as coefficient of friction, impact angle, impact energy and particle angular velocity on depassivation of 304 stainless steel and its erosion-corrosion. A depassivation mechanism was proposed that considered a combined effect of the friction force and its effective path of action on the surface.
In the last part improving the erosion-corrosion properties of 304 stainless steel was tried based on the results of the second part of the study. Samples were cold rolled and the effect of hardness on the coefficient of friction was investigated, which in the second part was proven responsible for the depassivation of the surface. It was found that the coefficient of friction between the particles and the surface remains unchanged in different applied percentages of cold work. Also it was shown that work hardening is an effective method for increasing the resistance of the material to erosion-corrosion.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: First and foremost, this work offers a critical review of recent influential environmental theorists’ efforts to construct and defend normatively significant accounts of wilderness.  As such, this work focuses on the definitions provided by environmental philosophers Eric Katz, Holmes Rolston III, J. Baird Callicott, Steven Vogel, and Val Plumwood. I suggest that insofar as Katz and Rolston rely on the problematically construed human-nature dichotomy, their definitions and moral arguments for the preservation of wilderness fail. While J. Baird Callicott’s definition provides an accurate account of wilderness, his ethical framework limits its normative force. Since Val Plumwood does not rely on the human-nature dichotomy, nor does she attempt to assign intrinsic value to wilderness and wild entities, her approach is the most successful.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Previous studies have found a positive relationship between trait dialecticism and ambivalent answering (Church et al., 2012; Hamamura et al., 2008). The current study explored how this relationship is affected for situational personality tests after manipulating the saliency of consistency norms (inconsistency vs. consistency manipulation), and classifying participants‘ reactions to the manipulations (Non-Reactance vs. Reactance). The results indicated that (1) Non-reactant participants showed a strong relationship between dialecticism and ambivalent answering in the inconsistency manipulation, but there was no relationship between the two in the consistency manipulation; and (2) Reactant participants showed a weaker relationship in the inconsistency manipulation, and a strong relationship in the consistency manipulation. In addition to these findings, the results indicated a positive relationship between self-knowledge and ambivalent answering, finding that the inconsistency manipulation significantly attenuates this relationship. Implications for cultural/personality research with experimental manipulations, and how to emphasize individual differences when designing manipulations, are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: The Didache’s imperatives to confess faults are located in an array of ritual practices similar to that of other Greco-Roman associations. Yet, there are distinctive ways in which each group strategically uses confessional practice within these arrays. In this thesis, I will argue that examining confession in the Didache as practice, in particular through the lens of Catherine Bell’s “ritualization,” exposes how certain activities are being privileged with respect to other activities and how these distinctions are ordered together into wholes that allow for their strategic use, manipulation, and adaptation. Specifically, the Didache utilizes confession in order to link “teaching,” as both oral tradition and written text, with a “way of life.” As a part of this argument, it will be necessary to suggest an extension to Bell’s understanding of the operation of misrecognition within ritualization in order to show how the Didache misrecognizes its own discourse of sacrifice.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This work is divided into two parts: (1) Synthesis of amine functionalized adsorbents using grafting technique for post-combustion CO2 capture, (2) Performance evaluation of structured bed configuration with straight gas flow channels using amine impregnated adsorbent for post-combustion CO2 capture. Brief description of each part is given below:
(1)	N-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)diethylenetriamine (DAEAPTS) grafted SBA-15 adsorbents were synthesized for CO2 capture. The adsorption of CO2 on the amine-grafted sorbents was measured by thermogravimetric method over a CO2 partial pressure range of 8−101.3 kPa and a temperature range of 25−105 °C under atmospheric pressure. The optimal amine loaded SBA-15 adsorbent was examined for multi-cycle stability and adsorption/desorption kinetics.
(2)	The performance of structured bed and packed bed configurations for post-combustion CO2 capture was evaluated using PEI impregnated SBA-15 adsorbent. The effect of adsorption temperature (25-90 °C), adsorption /desorption kinetics and multi-cycle stability was studied in both structured and packed bed configurations.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Using social positioning theory and the concept of the liminoid, the objectives of this qualitative research project were three-fold: 1) investigate how social positioning affects the information behaviour of volunteer tourists; 2) determine what effects cultural confusion (aka  “culture shock”), physical location, gender, technical skill, and previous intercultural education and/or experiences have on the information behaviour of volunteer tourists; and finally, 3) suggest how non-governmental organizations can use the research findings to assist volunteer tourists to successfully undertake their placements.  These questions were explored through observation and semi-structured interviews with fifteen volunteer tourists in Thailand.  Previous travel experience proved to be a significant predictor of participants’ information behaviour.  Volunteer tourists reported more consciousness of the embodiment of information and the concept of face than they did at home.  The results emphasize the importance of developing a theory of liminoidal information behaviour, in order to explore how people in the liminoid – a place between cultures where identities are often suspended – interact with information.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: First-line treatment of breast and other cancers with Taxol is compromised by resistance in up to 40% of patients.  To improve chemotherapy, it is vital to understand how Taxol resistance develops and to overcome this.  Autotaxin (ATX) promotes cancer cell survival, growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. ATX converts extracellular lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidate (LPA). As these lipids have been reported to affect cell signaling through their own G-protein-coupled receptors, ATX could modify the balance of this signaling. Also, ATX affects cell adhesion independently of its catalytic activity, We first investigated the interactions of ATX, LPC and LPA on the apoptotic effects of Taxol, which is commonly used in breast cancer treatment. LPC had no significant effect on Taxol-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which do not secrete significant ATX. Addition of incubation medium from MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells, which secrete ATX, or recombinant ATX enabled LPC to inhibit Taxol-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Inhibiting ATX activity blocked this protection against apoptosis. We conclude that LPC has no significant effect in protecting MCF-7 cells against Taxol treatment unless it is converted to LPA by ATX. LPA strongly antagonized Taxol-induced apoptosis through stimulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and inhibiting ceramide formation. LPA also partially reversed the Taxol-induced arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Then, we described a novel action of LPA, which by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase increases the expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß and survivin.  Survivin is an anti-apoptotic protein, which also increases the dynamicity of microtubules. Survivin decreased the effectiveness of Taxol in stabilizing microtubules and enabled MCF-7 breast cancer cells to escape from Taxol-induced arrest in G2/M and consequent cell death.  Our work showed that inhibiting ATX activity and LPA-mediated signaling can reverse the resistance to Taxol-induced cell death. Our results support the hypothesis that therapeutic inhibition of ATX activity, which results in less LPA production, or inhibition of LPA signalling could improve the efficacy of Taxol as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In-vitro expansion of the duct cells of the pancreas was associated with loss of the epithelial phenotype of these cells and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype. These changes have been explained by epithelial mesenchymal transition. 
We have tested the effect of several growth factors that have been used in epithelial cell cultures with a number of different base media. We used geneticin that has been used to limit the growth of mesenchymal cells. Flow cytometry was employed to determine the percentages of EpCAM and Vimentin positive cells in the NEPT. 
The use of geneticin was helpful in preserving epithelial cells (~70% EpCAM positive cells) compared to the control (56% EpCAM positive cells) after a week in culture. Moreover we observed that a pancreatic media yielded the highest percentage of EpCAM positive cells (27%) and the lowest percentage of Vimentin positive cells (55%) compared to conventional media after 20 days in vitro.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This project examined whether the availability of the semantic representations of the constituents of opaque compounds depends on the transparency of the first and second constituents. Four semantic priming experiments were conducted using a lexical decision task. Across the experiments, the transparency of the first or second constituents of compound primes was manipulated, while the transparency of the other constituent was held constant. Response times to targets preceded by related or unrelated compound primes were compared. Semantic priming was observed for all constituents, except the first constituents of fully opaque compounds. The lack of semantic priming for fully opaque compounds could be the result of a conflict between the constructed and retrieved meanings of these compounds (as discussed by Gagné &amp; Spalding, 2009; Ji, 2008; Ji, Gagné, &amp; Spalding, in press). This research suggests that constituent semantic representations are available and that semantic integration might occur even for opaque compounds.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Protein phosphorylation is a crucial component in physiological signal transduction pathways. It is estimated that one-third of all cellular proteins are modified through phosphorylation, and these pathways are regulated by kinase and phosphatase enzymes. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the last step in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by converting glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose. As a result, aberrant G6Pase signaling has been implicated in diabetes. The active site of G6Pase contains a nucleophilic histidine residue, and two arginine residues that stabilize binding through hydrogen bonding to the phosphate moiety. In this thesis we present novel synthetic methodology to install -bromophosphonate moieties on G6P analogues to test as irreversible inhibitors of G6Pase, which could serve as a valuable tool in the study of glucose metabolism. We describe our efforts towards the synthesis of a panel of phosphonate-based G6P analogues which were tested for in vitro activity against the enzyme.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: In oil recovery from fractured reservoirs, Dynamic Spontaneous Imbibition (DSI) plays an important role. Conventional equations used to characterize DSI neglect interfacial coupling effects (ICE). Moreover, no numerical model has considered a variable inlet saturation (S*) for DSI. An iteration scheme has been developed to solve Bentsen’s Transport Equation using a Lagrangian Formulation for which initial and boundary conditions have been derived to take into account a variable S* and ICE. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to study the effect of the fluid and rock properties on DSI. The results reveal that including a variable S* has insignificant impact; however, neglecting ICE results in an overestimation of the imbibition flow rate. It is important to mention that, based on the results of this study, the capillary and relative permeability curves determine the type of frontal advance, and that the imbibition recovery is proportional to the square root of time.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: This thesis explores the food practices of Southern Sudanese refugee women in Brooks, Alberta, illustrating how foodways (Long, 2004) impact and reflect women’s conceptions of themselves as gendered, multinational citizens. These women’s relationship to food is an ambivalent one; simultaneous food maintenance and re-creation represents women’s understandings about themselves within intersecting cosmopolitan and local identities. Women use food to connect them to their Southern Sudanese, Canadian, and cosmopolitan identities, and therefore embody ‘actually existing’ cosmopolitanism (Robbins, 1998).  Women demonstrate agency in their foodways as they utilize cosmopolitan praxis to gain status, address quotidian challenges, and question established gender norms. Ultimately, transnational foodways represent freedom for Southern Sudanese women as they indicate their willingness and ability to move through the boundaries of identification as needed. The result of this movement is not without tension and as women appropriate transnational foodways they negotiate the power encompassed in ethnic and national gendered identities.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Tumour resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy often prevents successful cancer therapy. This has promoted the search for novel agents that target specific molecular pathways linked to tumour resistance to cancer therapy. Among these novel agents are inhibitors of the inducible isoform of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, COX-2, which is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, migration and invasion of cells, and the inhibition of apoptosis.The aim of the project is to study novel selective COX-2 inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. COX-2 expression levels in various cell lines were determined via western blot. HCA-7 cells, a human colorectal cell line, were found to have a high baseline expression of COX-2, while HCT-116 cells, also a human colorectal cell line, were not found to express COX-2. The metabolic and proliferative activity of HCA-7 and HCT-116 cellswere characterized through cell uptake studies involving 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), and 3’-deoxy-3’-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT). The cells were treated with varying concentrations of selective COX-2 inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy. Inhibitors included celecoxib, the current “gold standard” for selective COX-2 inhibitors as radiosensitizers, and a novel pyrimidine-based selective COX-2 inhibitor, pyricoxib. Toxicity of the compounds was examined through the methylthiazoltetrazolium(MTT) assay. Occurrence of apoptotic events were measured by labelling cells with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) followed by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with GIEMSA stain and β-galactosidase stain to examine cell morphology and level of senescence. HCA-7 and HCT-116 cells were found to have high metabolic and proliferative activity based on their [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT cell uptake profile, respectively. Pyricoxib was found to be less toxic to cells than celecoxib. Cells were resistant to radiation-induced cell death at doses up to 20 Gy. Cells treated with selective COX-2 inhibitors did not exhibit decreased cell metabolic activity indicative of increased cell death after irradiation compared to non-irradiated cells based on the MTT assay. Neither compound appeared to produce a significant radiosensitization response based on apoptotic events, but in fact appeared to produce a radioprotective effect. When examined by GIEMSA stain in HCA-7 cells, both drugs produced more large cells with less tumour-like populations when combined with irradiation compared to the control and to HCT-116 cells.  Finally, chemoradiation with coxibs did not result in an increased number of senescent cells compared to either therapy alone. Only pyricoxib in the COX-2 positive cells produced an enhanced level of senescence, but it was not greater than an additive effect.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Objectives - To systematically review literature on rural-urban differences in pediatric injury incidence and to examine incidence of all-cause injury, agricultural injury, and injury-related health care utilization for farm children compared to several groups of non-farm children under 18 years of age in Alberta, Canada.
Methods – A systematic review examined population-based observational studies published from 1970 to August 2013, that compared rates or health care outcomes of injury between rural and urban children (&lt;18) living in Canada or the United States. Three of population-based retrospective cohort studies followed farm, rural, First Nations (FN), urban children from 1999 to 2010 to examine incidence of injury and related health services using the linkage of four administrative health databases (data from physician visits to deaths). Person-time incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated based on injury episode.
Results – Systematic review demonstrated that rural children sustained a higher rate of overall injury, particularly from MVC and suicide than urban children. Primary studies showed farm and rural children, especially rural FN children, had higher rates and greater utilizations of overall injury, especially for severe injuries, than urban children. This trend was consistent for most injury mechanisms but more notably for other land transport (e.g., ATVs, animal riding, agricultural vehicle-related injuries), natural/environmental (e.g., bees, insects, animals-related), and unintentional firearm-related injuries. Farm and rural non-FN children were at a greater risk of agricultural injuries, more outstandingly for farm-animal and machinery-related injuries, than rural FN and urban children. Agricultural injuries appeared to be more unintentional and lethal. Rural FN children, followed by rural non-FN and farm children, experienced greater utilization of higher levels of medical facilities, thinner shapes of injury pyramid, and greater proportions of pre-hospital deaths.
Conclusions – Greater burden of injury for farm and rural children and specific patterns per group indicate a need for targeted and specialized injury prevention strategies for higher-risk mechanisms in each group, attention for agricultural injury controls to extended populations, comprehensive intervention strategies for underlying inter-related causes of injury in rural areas, and an advanced pediatric trauma care for serious injuries the ED for efficient and timely care in rural areas.</etd_ms:description>

                    <etd_ms:description>Abstract: Wildlife habitat selection is influenced by gender, offspring-dependency, resource availability, and spatiotemporal variation in resource nutrition. In consideration of these factors, this thesis examines alpine sweetvetch (Hedysarum alpinum) root and its relationship to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in west-central Alberta, Canada. I observed sexually segregated, offspring-dependent functional responses in selection for sweetvetch habitat that was further affected by inter-annual patterns in spring climate (i.e., Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Selection patterns suggested that habitat segregation was due to differences in nutritional requirements between sexes and offspring predation risk. Nutritional analyses of roots indicated that temporal patterns in protein content were influenced by spatial variations in temperature and soil. This spatiotemporal heterogeneity benefits grizzly bears by prolonging the availability of nutritious roots, and may explain why sweetvetch habitats in the mountains were relied upon throughout the spring and how bears could rely on a root digging (habitat) strategy.</etd_ms:description>
